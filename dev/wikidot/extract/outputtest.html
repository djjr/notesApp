In most cases the match is tenuous. I almost no case can a reasonable mapping be made from the exam response to level in rubric UNLESS we ex ante decide to match a wrong answer with P (poor) and a correct answer with one of the other levels depending on what this particular question might provide student with opportunity to demonstrate. For example, the first question permits us to see the student drawing conclusions from analysis but we cannot distinguish whether she is \"hesitant or uncertain\" vs. \"insightful\" and offers \"carefully qualified conclusions.\" Thus, getting this question right probably tells me it is not a P but I don't know whether it is F, G, or E level.</p>\n<table class=\"assesstable\">\n<tbody><tr class=\"assesscell\">\n<td class=\"artifact\"></td>\n<td class=\"QG1R\"><span class=\"hover\">QG1R<span><strong>Representation:</strong> Ability to convert relevant information into various mathematical or algoritmic forms.</span></span></td>\n<td class=\"QG1C\"><span class=\"hover\">QG1C<span>Calculation</span></span></td>\n<td class=\"QG1I\"><span class=\"hover\">QG1I<span><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Ability to explain information presented in mathematical or algorithmic forms.</span></span></td>\n<td class=\"QG2AA\"><span class=\"hover\">QG2AA <span><strong>Application/Analysis:</strong> Ability to make judgments and draw appropriate conclusions based on the quantitative analysis of data, while recognizing</span></span></td>\n<td class=\"QG2A\"><span class=\"hover\">QG2A<span><strong>Assumptions:</strong> Ability to make and evaluate important assumptions in estimation, modeling, and data analysis</span></span></td>\n<td class=\"QG2C\"><span class=\"hover\">QG2C<span><strong>Communication:</strong> Expressing quantitative evidence in support of the argument or purpose of the work (in terms of what evidence is used and how it is formatted, presented, and contextualized).</span></span></td>\n<td class=\"assesscellcomments\">Comments</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"assesscell\"><a href=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:assess-quant/stats01.png\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/major21:assess-quant/stats01.png/medium.jpg\" alt=\"stats01.png\" class=\"image\"></a></td>\n<td class=\"assesscellNA\">n/a</td>\n<td class=\"assesscellNA\">n/a</td>\n<td class=\"assesscellNA\">n/a</td>\n<td class=\"QG2AA\">YES</td>\n<td class=\"QG2A\">MAYBE</td>\n<td class=\"assesscellNA\">n/a</td>\n<td class=\"assesscellcomments\">Assumptions are involved but no need to make them explicit.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"assesscell\"><a href=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:assess-quant/stats02.png\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/major21:assess-quant/stats02.png/medium.jpg\" alt=\"stats02.png\" class=\"image\"></a></td>\n<td class=\"assesscellNA\">n/a</td>\n<td class=\"QG1C\">YES</td>\n<td class=\"assesscellNA\">n/a</td>\n<td class=\"QG2AA\">YES</td>\n<td class=\"QG2A\">maybe</td>\n<td class=\"assesscellNA\">n/a</td>\n<td class=\"assesscellcomments\">Some calculations and application.

Assessment Task</span></h3>\n<p>The assessment task means re-evaluating every single student solution not just for right and wrong but for what it does or does not reveal about her skills. If all we have is right/wrong you can't map it onto the levels of the rubric without making silly assumptions. In many cases the artifact item simply does not contain enough detail to detect the elements that are built into the levels. At best you could say \"getting number 5 right counts as GOOD on outcome 3,\" deciding ex ante that the item does not give student chance to demonstrate excellence on that outcome.</p>\n<p>One could take a slap-dash-crank-something-out approach, but to do anything that had any validity I think we end up spending many more hours than the result would be worth.</p>\n<p>All told we have something like ~1800 items in the artifact collection (5 different ones). First step is to map the items onto the 6 goals - each item tagged with one or more goals it arguably measures/detects/provides opportunity for competence demonstration. We have about 50 separate questions/problems. Allow 2 hours for this task. It only need be done once.</p>\n<p>Next we evaluate each of these items for how getting it right/wrong or partially right/wrong would map onto the levels in the rubric. Assume each item matches just one learning goal. This means only 50x4 evaluations. Allow 1 minute of thought and note taking for each: 3.3 hours.</p>\n<p>Next obtain answer keys for exams and create Excel spreadsheet for recording levels for each item. Allow 1 hour for clerical set up.</p>\n<p>Review each artifact, recording learning outcome level for each question. Assuming just one goal per question/problem this means only about 1800 decisions. Assume each one can be completed and recorded in 30 seconds. Total time: 900 minutes = 15 hours.</p>\n<p>Transfer data from spreadsheet to TaskStream. Assume about 1 minute per artifact. Time: 1 hour.</p>\n<p>Under these ver optimistic assumptions time budget would be something like this:</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<th>Task</th>\n<th>Time</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Learn the goals</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1 hour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tag questions/problems</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Map student performance to rubric</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Obtain/review answer keys</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Evaluate artifacts</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Transfer data</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Total</th>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">~23 hours</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>Assuming all would not go smoothly and anyone who wanted to do a careful job on a task that is full of ambiguity would end up spending far too long on components of the task I would estimate this amount of time plus 50% brining total to about 35 hours.</p>\n<p>If we have three reviewers there is some discount due to part of task not needing to be repeated so let's conservatively estimate that this assessment task will require about 80 hours of faculty time.</p>\n<p>The average hourly wage (very very crudely calculated - it's arguably much higher) for faculty is on the order of $50. Thus, the actual cost of the assessment is something like $4000 plus administrative costs). If the standard stipend offered to faculty is $500 that means (1) it's being remunerated at something like $15-20/hour, and (2) to get the task done faculty members effectively donate more to the task than the institution allocates for it.</p>\n<p>To actually assess the overall cost we need to include the effort of the faculty members who teach these courses and their respective department heads. Between this expense and that of the Office of Institutional Research a conservative estimate might be another 40 hours of work bringing the project total up to around $5-$6,000.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc5\"><span>Learning Outcomes</span></h3>\n<p>And what will we learn from this? Our motivation here is to determine whether our quantitative requirement as implemented is achieving its goals. Based on a sample of about 100 students taking courses that are tagged with this requirement (out of perhaps 1000 course takings?), using a metric that's not all that well designed to capture variations in the outcomes described, what will we get? A distribution of sample students on each of six outcomes. We CANNOT take the weighted average of these (that is, count poor as 1, fair as 2, etc.) since we have done nothing at all to ascertain whether we have an interval scale (we almost certainly do not).</p>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:assess-quant/q-histogram.png\" alt=\"q-histogram.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<p>So, how would we make changes to our quantitative requirements based on this? I do not think we could. The only reasonable outcome would be to revise our assessment methods.</p>\n<p>That's what I think we should do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"toc6\"><span>Short Term Solution</span></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Abandon notion of having three raters for these artifacts. No reason at all to assess mathematical work with multiple raters.</li>\n<li>Tag all artifact items (problems, questions, assignments) as done above for statistics exam. This creates a binary matrix that is 54 items by 6 outcomes.</li>\n<li>Obtain original grading for all submitted artifacts. This should produce a matrix which is 98 artifacts (students) by variable number of graded items.</li>\n<li>For each class do the appropriate multiplication of results by tags to yield the scores on each outcome. Normalize by number of scores.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>NOTE that this will NOT code directly into the levels of the rubric. What it will yield is a score for each outcome: what fraction of opportunities to demonstrate this competence resulted in a demonstration of this competence.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc7\"><span>Long Term Solution</span></h3>\n<p>Elaborate the goals a bit so that they have enough concreteness than any instructor could easily tag exam questions, problems, etc. with the outcomes the item \"detects\" and offer a key to get from the grade on the question or problem to the level in the rubric.</p>\n<p>The process of so formulating things should be iterated with an examination of how the data will be used. What policy and curriculum decisions do we imagine might be informed by this data? Based on the answer to that question, what should this data look like. To ignore this part of the process is to waste people's time and the institution's resources.</p>\n<p>THIS MUST be done in such a manner that it makes teaching the course LESS NOT MORE difficult. That's a challenge, but if assessment is going to be a sustainable part of what we are doing, then it must be so.</p>",

The Faculty-Staff Meeting-Time Budget. We begin each year with a budget based on how much of various employees' time each week it seems reasonable to spend in meetings. Each employee knows how much time she is assigned and each \"manager\" knows how much time the people she manages have available for meetings.<br>\nEvery meeting gets booked against the overall institutional budget as well as individual budgets.</p>\n<p>Solution 2. Pricing meetings. Each time a meeting is called we tally up the cost to the institution based on those who are invited to the meeting and its length. To keep things simple we might come up with an average cost for various classes of employee.</p>\n<p>Solution 3. Each year we feature a meeting style protocol. Before the year starts we distribute written materials, workshops are available during opening weeks of academic year, committee chairs and others who call meetings are required to attend a workshop on the technique of the year. The idea is to infuse a repertoire of meeting skills into the community over time and to sync people up each year. The ultimate goal is less time spent in more productive meetings.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc0\"><span>See Also</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://icymi-mills.blogspot.com/2014/04/meeting-as-wasted-time-made-not-born.html\">Meetings as Wasted Time: Made, Not Born</a>.

Usually this is for courses where there is pedagogical value in being exposed to the core ideas, the relation to other aspects of the discipline/field, and some of the substantive subtopics as contrasted with courses where a larger array of subparts must be \"covered\" if one is to say one has studied the topic.</p>\n<p>Note that this last step is hard and in some cases we have to say \"I'm pretty sure I could figure out how to do that well though it would take some work.\" There is an obvious tradeoff between number of areas a student learns something about and how much a student learns about each area. We think there's a value to breadth and that depth can be achieved by how one teaches not just how long a course lasts.</p>\n<p>In anticipation of the need to deliver course title variety with limited full time staffing we try to identify more rather than fewer courses as candidates for being taught as half semester modules.</p>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:bottomup-program-fte-deployment/courses-2.png\" alt=\"courses-2.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<p>At this stage, we don't worry about what will rotate with what, but we did aim to have the number of 3-year rotating full semester courses be a multiple of 3.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc2\"><span>Step 3: Connect offerings with deployment of instructional FTE</span></h4>\n<p>Next we count up how much instructional FTE we need to field this list of courses. We start with 6 semester length requirements which we want to offer every year.</p>\n<p>Next we count multiple sections. Intro enrollments are high enough (about 70 per year) to warrant 2 sections of each intro course.</p>\n<p>We also have one service course we teach for the public policy graduate program.</p>\n<p>Altogether this comes out to 9 semester length offerings per year. Thus, the required part of the curriculum requires about 2 FTE. What will it take to build the elective curriculum we started to imagine above? We start by assuming 3 FTE TT faculty at 5 semester length offerings per year so we have 6 \"slots\" to play with.</p>\n<p>We propose to deploy these as follows:</p>\n<p>1 slot for a 3 semester-length-courses in 3 year rotation (A &amp; B &amp; C)<br>\n2 slots for 4 semester courses on a 2 year rotation (D &amp; E, F &amp; G, H &amp; I)<br>\n3 slots for 12 module length courses on a 2 year rotation (J &amp; K, L &amp; M, N &amp; O, P &amp; Q, R &amp; S, T &amp; U)</p>\n<p>All told this yields 26 course titles to which 4 year students would have access (2 year transfers would see 25 titles).</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc3\"><span>Step 4: Build Four Year Schedule Framework</span></h4>\n<p>To keep things simple we gave our required courses short mnemonic names and we numbered electives S1, S2 and M1, M2, etc. based on whether they were semester or module length courses.</p>\n<p>At this stage our major looks like this<br></p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Intro Soc + Cult Anth + Methods Mod 1 + Methods Mod 2 + Theory + Junior Seminar + Senior Seminar + ELECTIVES</p>\n</div>\n<br>\nwhich we abbreviate like this<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>INTRO1 + INTRO2 + REQ2A + REQ2B + REQ3 + JSem + SSem + ELECTIVES</p>\n</div>\n<p>Since these will be offered every year we put them into a four year course schedule first. We are assuming we need to offer two sections of our two intro courses.</p>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:bottomup-program-fte-deployment/courses-3a-bw.png\" alt=\"courses-3a-bw.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<p>This requires us to use 9 of 15 course \"slots\" (we are counting under the old system for now) that our 3 FTE staffing provides. We also have one elective which we teach each year as a service course for the graduate public policy program so we add that to the schedule too.</p>\n<p>Next we put our rotating courses into the schedule. First we have S1, S2, and S3 which are in a 3 year rotation. NOTE: we are placing these in fall or spring in anticipation of balancing instructors' schedules which comes at a later step. No need to worry about that at this stage.</p>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:bottomup-program-fte-deployment/courses-3c-bw.png\" alt=\"courses-3c-bw.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<p>And then the two year rotation semester courses:</p>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:bottomup-program-fte-deployment/courses-3d-bw.png\" alt=\"courses-3d-bw.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<p>And finally our 2 year rotation module offerings:</p>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:bottomup-program-fte-deployment/courses-3e-bw.png\" alt=\"courses-3e-bw.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<h4 id=\"toc4\"><span>Step 5: The Four Year Schedule</span></h4>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:bottomup-program-fte-deployment/courses-4b.png\" alt=\"courses-4b.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<h4 id=\"toc5\"><span>Step 6: Staffing, Workloads, Etc.</span></h4>\n<p>The program has 6 required courses, all of which are taught each year. Intro courses are taught in two sections. One intro course is team taught by two professors, and one is taught as two sections by one professor. A junior and senior seminar are taught in rotation with the instructor who teaches the junior seminar in a spring semester also teaching the senior seminar the following fall. Each faculty member has a course taught in three year rotation that s/he teaches in the year s/he teaches neither the junior or senior seminar. We might think of this as \"senior treat\" advanced topic course.</p>\n<p>The rotation below features 12 modular courses, M, (some of which could be joined together when they are adjacent) 8 semester courses, S. This layout takes into account 1 course offered as a service course annually for the PPOL graduate program. Each semester features 5 elective courses and 4 required courses. Except for S1, S2, and S3, all electives are on a two year rotation so transfer students would likely see all of them.</p>\n<p>This layout would require each of us to rethink some of our semester courses into modules.</p>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:bottomup-program-fte-deployment/courses-5.png\" alt=\"courses-5.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<h4 id=\"toc6\"><span>Step 7: Building-in Exception Handling</span></h4>\n<p>Next steps would be to adjust FTE allocations to take into account exceptions we can anticipate.</p>\n<p>Normal operating procedures cause bumps to collide with plans like these. These include sabbaticals, administrative assignments, unscheduled leaves, etc.</p>\n<p>As a first cut at building in tolerance for these we compute the sabbatical expectation as 1 semester per 7 years per faculty member. This means that in a 4 year schedule with 3 TTT faculty we should budget for 2 semesters of replacement (or build the schedule around that many fewer FTE to deploy over time). In the first approximation we don't try to anticipate the exact timing but we do want to make sure the instructional budget - either the salary side or the deployable instructional FTE side - takes this into account when we design the schedule.</p>\n<p>At this stage we might want to add \"buffer FTE\" (that is, budgeted adjunct slots) to allow for course experimentation - important to build this in rather than making innovation an exception. The amount of flexibility could be rationalized at the institution or division level. It might be linked to oscillations of student interest, programatic R&amp;D, etc. Fractional flexibility could be used to encourage cross-department collaboration on fielding of courses. Etc.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc7\"><span>Other Advantages</span></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>a four year schedule would always allow all students enrolled at the college to anticipate and plan their educations</li>\n<li>a four year schedule would make the bi-annual ritual of staffing sheet submission much simpler since deans and department heads would be confirming and modifying rather than drafting from scratch</li>\n<li>divisional instructional budgets would be less unwieldy to construct, understand, and build plans around</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><strong>THE LATEST IDEAS</strong></span></p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\">    \n\n<span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:bottomup-program-fte-deployment\">BottomUp Program FTE Deployment</a> |</span><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:preparing-for-free-community-college\">Preparing for Free Community College</a> |</span><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:who-can-afford-us\">Who Can Afford a SLAC Education?</a> |</span><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:merit-aid-students-faculty-research\">Use \"Merit\" Aid to Connect Students to Faculty in Research</a> |</span><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:shatter-the-semester\">Shatter the Semester</a> |</span><br>\n\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<div style=\"background-color: beige;\">\n<h3 id=\"toc8\"><span>Talk/Comments/Feedback</span></h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"comments-box\">\n\t\t\n\t<div class=\"options\" id=\"comments-options-hidden\" style=\"display: none\">\n\t\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumCommentsModule.listeners.showComments(event)\">Show Comments</a> \n\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t<div id=\"thread-container\" class=\"thread-container\" style=\"margin-top: 1em\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\tWIKIDOT.forumThreadId = 1941272;\n</script>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"thread-container-posts\" style=\"display: none\">\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n        <a href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"new-post-button\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumViewThreadModule.listeners.newPost(event,null)\" style=\"display:  block ; margin-bottom:1em\">Add a New Comment</a>\n\n \n\n<div style=\"display:none\" id=\"post-options-template\">\n\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumViewThreadModule.listeners.showPermalink(event,'%POST_ID%')\" class=\"btn btn-default btn-small btn-sm\">Permanent Link</a>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumViewThreadModule.listeners.editPost(event,'%POST_ID%')\" class=\"btn btn-default btn-small btn-sm\">Edit</a>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumViewThreadModule.listeners.deletePost(event,'%POST_ID%')\" class=\"btn btn-danger btn-small btn-sm\">Delete</a>\n</div>\n\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\n</div>",

But there is a tendency in academia, because the software investment is usually made by administrators, for software to be more related to the work of administrators than instructors. Whether it succeeds in making them more productive is an empirical question. What is not a question, though, is that the place where you want a productivity gain in high education is on the instructional side. Unfortunately almost all of the software that administrators select has the effect of making instructors LESS productive. And all manner of other practices follow the same pattern - from the reports that must be submitted to the meetings that must be attended. And more often than not you can trace this to the problem of organizational visibility that James Scott described.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"draft\"><img src=\"http://djjr-courses.wikidot.com/local--files/major21:images/draft00.png\" alt=\"draft00.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<div class=\"image-container floatright\"><a href=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:deploying-faculty-time/scott-forest.png\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/major21:deploying-faculty-time/scott-forest.png/medium.jpg\" alt=\"scott-forest.png\" class=\"image\"></a></div>\n<p>My colleague, Mark Henderson, reminded me recently that a natural urge for an administrator or manager is to implement practices and technologies that increase the visibility (or what James Scott called \"legibility\"<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a id=\"footnoteref-1\" href=\"javascript:;\" class=\"footnoteref\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>) of the organization's workings to a person who sits where they sit. Once implemented, such systems make it look to the manager like things work better than before because she can see them more clearly. But this increased visibility tends to generate blindness too.</p>\n<p>There is a related phenomenon - people at the top of organizations often track some stuff that makes them blind in this way but then seem to deliberately leave other things murky and obscured in a way that lets them ignore inconvenient details.</p>\n<p>Administrators are famous for treating faculty time as a free and infinitely elastic resource. Because faculty work is relatively invisible and because as professionals and educators faculty tend to absorb the work and always manage to get the teaching done, administrators as individuals might be forgiven for this. But can we develop some tools that will help both faculty and administrators recognize the shape and size of this core institutional resource in hopes of improving the way it is deployed to achieve institutional goals?</p>\n<p>Thought experiment: how many faculty-person-hours do I have at my disposal if I am running a SLAC? Let's suppose we have 100 faculty members working full time and each teaches 5 courses per year with the equivalent of a sixth course in advising and committee work. Let's further make the most conservative assumption that faculty work only during 34 weeks of term time (about 1400 hours) and that the research vs teaching/advising/service breakdown during this time is 1:9 (allowing faculty about 1/2 day per week for research).</p>\n<p>If we allocate faculty work by the 5-6 rule then the 1260 hours available is divided as 1050 for teaching five courses and 210 for advising/service/etc. If we make the unrealistic assumption to treat teaching weeks and non-teaching weeks as identical we have over the 34 weeks (2 x 14 instructional weeks + prep week + exams + grading) and that the five courses are spread evenly over the two semesters this yields</p>\n<p>30 hours instruction<br>\n6 hours service/advising<br>\n4 hours research</p>\n<p>If we assume a salary of $100k then the hourly rate is about $73. Thus, for advising and service we allocate about $400 per full time faculty member per week.</p>\n<p>$2200 instruction<br>\n$440 service/advising<br>\n$294 research</p>\n<p>Now imagine you install a new expense tracking system and it costs Z and permits savings of W by the waste it prevents and X by the audit costs it reduces and Y by the clerical work it saves. In addition, it provides reports that give decision makers the feeling that they have a better appreciation for what is going on in the organization.</p>\n<p>Imagine too that part of this transition involves requiring faculty members to enter their own reimbursement for travels and expenses. They do not do it often so they develop no deep familiarity with the system and each time they must be reimbursed it involves one hour of data entry, correspondence, etc. Let's assume each faculty member does this three times per year. To the institutional cost should be added 100 x 3 x $73=$22000.</p>\n<p>One might argue that most faculty reimbursement is for faculty travel and most faculty travel is research related and so the best place to allocate this is on that line. If we do that, then we have</p>\n<p>(3x73)/(34x294)=2% tax on faculty research<br>\nor<br>\n(3x73)/(34x440)=1.5% tax on advising<br>\nor<br>\n(3x73)/(34x2200)=0.3% tax on teaching</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>.

Outputs include teaching, advising, planning, managing, etc. This project involves creating a system for institutional self-awareness around the allocation of these resources.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"toc0\"><span>Introduction</span></h3>\n<p>It is amusing sometimes to watch college and university managers engaged in \"budgeting.\" At least in the small college context it rarely amounts to much more than small changes at the margin that create extreme levels of conflict and very little substantive change.</p>\n<p>One reason, I think, is that the managers do not, in general, really understand the resources they are budgeting and what the organization is producing. And the relationship between these two is beyond rocket science in most cases.</p>\n<p>One could argue that the problem is that presidents and deans and provosts and the like simply don't have a good grasp on what people do all day and how that ends up producing the thing that gets sold to parents and donors and employers. And so, even when they dress it up in fancy terms, all they end up budgeting is dollars to departments.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc1\"><span>People and Their Time Not Database Categories and Their Amounts</span></h3>\n<p>Higher education produces almost nothing tangible. There is no loading dock from which product is shipped, no issue which hits the newstands each morning, no finished structure that can be put on the market. There are analogs to each of these, of course, and we make lame attempts to quantize things (counting up number of degrees produced or credit hours or publications), but the analogies feel stretched.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc2\"><span>Things that Scale and Things that Don't</span></h3>\n<p>A big concern in the worlds of commerce, manufacturing, and communication is \"scaling.\" In general terms this is the question of whether what you can figure out how to do for 10 clients you can also figure out how to do for 10,000. In most cases, some parts of one's operation scale favorably (the marginal cost goes down), some scale nicely (the effects of increasing scale do not cripple you), some stepwise (it's all fine up to 500 but then suddenly costs jump), some nastily (growth beyond a certain point gums up the works and shuts you down).</p>\n<p>When making changes to curriculum, requirements, rules, procedures, etc. it is important to examine the changes with respect to scaling. What will the impact be when the change applies to all students? What happens if the program is wildly popular? What will the impact be on each faculty member when the new policy goes into place?</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc3\"><span>Penny-Wise and Pound Foolish as a Standard Operating Principle</span></h3>\n<p>One of the most commonly annoying practices in higher education is the decision to save money on a clerical task by transferring it to faculty and then laying off or re-assigning a staff employee. Suppose there is some process that faculty members are currently not involved in; it is handled by a $45,000 per year staff member. Then a genius comes along and buys some software that allows students to go to their advisor with the same issue and have the advisor go online and enter the appropriate information. On average advisors have 10 advisees, say, and each of them needs this service once per semester. All told it takes one half hour of faculty work each time (meeting with student, remembering how to use the software, etc.). That's 1000 students times a half hour per semester. Faculty time is worth on average something like $65. This change has moved a task from a place where it cost under $45,000 per year (assuming the staff member did other things) to a place where it costs $65,000 per year. And, assuming faculty were fully employed before the change, something that had been considered valuable is either no longer being done or is now being done on unpaid overtime.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc4\"><span>Example Calculations and Considerations</span></h3>\n<p>Suppose your institution has 100 full time faculty members and that the \"profile\" for faculty is 70:10:20 (70% teaching, 10% service, and 20% research) and that advising is included under teaching. During term time you have 100 persons * 0.1 * 40 hours/week = 400 person-hours/week for service. How will we allocate it?<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a id=\"footnoteref-1\" href=\"javascript:;\" class=\"footnoteref\"

It was an old idea in higher education even then. And our original proposals were built around having funding to do things we were already doing, not on real changes to the status quo. At this point it is a tired idea that gets recited like a mantra but no individual is actually sufficiently jazzed about it to take an entrepreneurial lead. It is an unimpressive idea (likely non-fundable as yesterday's news) that absorbs lots of funds, shifts resources from teaching faculty to teaching teaching faculty, and in general addresses perhaps real but probably not pressing problems (no one is complaining that the teachers around here are doing a poor job). Almost certainly does not contribute to recruitment or retention. What purpose does it usually serve? A small number of faculty who want to redefine themselves as teaching experts and a general desire on the part of faculty to talk to one another about teaching and have it emphasized as important. The latter can be accomplished through other means, the former is not the institution's problem to solve. There are many things that TaLCs do that can be done without one; how many of these have we even explored?</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc1\"><span>Alternative Vision</span></h3>\n<p>An alternative proposal: an <strong>education innovation design lab</strong> dedicated to exploring, developing, and adapting tools and techniques for majoring in the 21st century. It will bring the practices of design thinking and lessons from lean startups to the task of rethinking higher education from the inside. Version 0.0 will be conceptual and virtual built by redefining the work of select staff/faculty who are jazzed at the idea. It will NOT presume that faculty members do not know how to teach and that non-faculty members can help them learn how to do it. Only at version 1.0 will it need a space/staff. Initial focus on gathering a few examples of existing innovative teaching/learning here and a few from easy to access nearby institutions and packaging and branding these as a thing. Version 0.1 will be to plan a calendar of events for a semester. During this time we develop an innovation curriculum for workshops in curricular innovation. Version 0.2 Convince administration to dedicate fac dev funds to support series of workshops in which groups of faculty are trained in the art of course and curriculum redesign. Workshops built around the actual redesign of actual courses and curricula. By end of year one we can showcase, say, one redesigned major, 5 courses, 3 learning modules. Version 1.0 to take shape over the following summer. Fall workshops on tweaking spring courses and designing new majors. MORE TO COME…</p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Teacher as Lead Student</strong> Rather than talking about sending our students off to do online courses we know nothing about (either their content or their quality) as a substitute for courses we DO teach, why not expand our own reach, have some fun, and do well by our students by taking online courses WITH them?</p>\n<p>A few of us, for example, are talking about a Data Scientist major/minor/grad program. We have some pieces of this with current TTT staff, but a number of critical parts are missing. To field the program we'd need adjuncts or a full time hire. But we could do proof of concept (one aspect of which is to explore demand and fit with the rest of our programs) by using online courses as the supplement but with a twist. The twist is that faculty members would take the course as \"lead student\" and then play the role of tutor to the Mills students who are taking the course. It's interesting for the faculty member because she learns something new that she's been thinking about learning anyway. It's great for the students on several levels - she has a better online experience than she would otherwise, she gets to see her teacher learning, and she gets first rate tutoring. And for the college and faculty member, some learning gets delivered at a much lower effort level and cost level than would otherwise have been the case.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\"><strong>THE LATEST IDEAS</strong></span></p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\">    \n\n<span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:bottomup-program-fte-deployment\">BottomUp Program FTE Deployment</a> |</span><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:preparing-for-free-community-college\">Preparing for Free Community College</a> |</span><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:who-can-afford-us\">Who Can Afford a SLAC Education?</a> |</span><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:merit-aid-students-faculty-research\">Use \"Merit\" Aid to Connect Students to Faculty in Research</a> |</span><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:shatter-the-semester\">Shatter the Semester</a> |</span><br>\n\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<hr>\n<hr>\n<div style=\"background-color: beige;\">\n<h3 id=\"toc0\"><span>Talk/Comments/Feedback</span></h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"comments-box\">\n\t\t\n\t<div class=\"options\" id=\"comments-options-hidden\" style=\"display: none\">\n\t\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumCommentsModule.listeners.showComments(event)\">Show Comments</a> \n\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t<div id=\"thread-container\" class=\"thread-container\" style=\"margin-top: 1em\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\tWIKIDOT.forumThreadId = 1427676;\n</script>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"thread-container-posts\" style=\"display: none\">\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n        <a href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"new-post-button\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumViewThreadModule.listeners.newPost(event,null)\" style=\"display:  block ; margin-bottom:1em\">Add a New Comment</a>\n\n \n\n<div style=\"display:none\" id=\"post-options-template\">\n\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumViewThreadModule.listeners.showPermalink(event,'%POST_ID%')\" class=\"btn btn-default btn-small btn-sm\">Permanent Link</a>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumViewThreadModule.listeners.editPost(event,'%POST_ID%')\" class=\"btn btn-default btn-small btn-sm\">Edit</a>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumViewThreadModule.listeners.deletePost(event,'%POST_ID%')\" class=\"btn btn-danger btn-small btn-sm\">Delete</a>\n</div>\n\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\n</div><div id=\"files-412901\">\n\t<p>\n\t\tNo files attached to this page.\t\t\n\t</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\tfunction updateFileSimpleList412901(pageNo){\n\t\t\tvar p = {};\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tp.page_id=28004104;\n\t\t\tvar containerElId = 'files-412901';\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tp.page = pageNo;\n\t\t\tOZONE.ajax.requestModule(\"files/PageFilesSimpleModule\", p, function(r){\n\t\t\t\tif(!WIKIDOT.utils.handleError(r)) {return;}\n\t\t\t\t//alert(r.body);\n\t\t\t\tjQuery('#'+containerElId).replaceWith(r.body);\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t}\n\t</script>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" class=\"manage-attachments-link\">\n\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.filesClick(null)\">Manage attachments</a>\n</p>\n</div>",

The stories colleges tell have to do with diversity and openness, but taking a position in the rankings game is also a part of the story. The Hechinger report below mentions a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/18/opinion/18diver.html\">NYT op-ed by then president of Reed</a> criticizing the move as a ploy to get low scoring applicants out of the SAT calculations for ratings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Bill Gates made a similar statement regarding the use of SATs as a definition of quality in an interview with The Chronicle in 2012.

It's not a gigantic study but it asks many of the right questions without getting mired in big debates such as test bias. Among the findings seem to be that test-submitters and test-non-submitters did equally well in college performance - that is, admissions processes were able to screen without test scores as well as with. There were also hints - but I'd have to read more closely to verify - that students who took SATs but did not submit \"outperformed\" themselves - that is, what their scores would have predicted (see also this <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/blogs/headcount/at-test-optional-colleges-students-surpass-the-scores-they-didnt-submit/37633\">piece</a> on the Hiss/Franks report in CoHE on this question).

One of the first colleges to do was Bard College, whose President (of over 35 years) has been a leader in his critique of the SATs. Under his leadership and with his redesigned admissions process (which I realize is not what we are talking about) Bard has steadily risen in its standing. Here's his recent <a href=\"http://time.com/15199/college-president-sat-is-part-hoax-and-part-fraud/\">critique of the SATs in Time magazine</a> (in a much quoted article.)</p>\n<p>…think that SAT optional would send a strong message of inclusion as well as broadening our pool of strong applicants. It would also respond to recent research on racial/cultural bias in the test. See <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/06/21/sat\">2010 Inside Higher Ed article</a>.</p>\n<p>…agree that the SAT optional is a good one for us. I think the SAT can provide some useful information for colleges and universities, especially those with more student applicants than they can grant admission to. At this point, I do not think we are in that position. Union College adopted the SAT optional policy many years ago without any noticeable effect on the quality of the student body.</p>\n<p>One idea he proposed that you might begin to think about is becoming an \"SAT optional\" school. You can begin an exploration online of the growing number of SAT Optional schools — which include many top liberal arts colleges and now totals well over 800 colleges and universities. Being SAT optional can be done in any number of ways, but essentially provides a pathway for students who are bright and have tremendous potential but who may not excel at timed, standardized tests. Some schools offer complex alternatives, and some just allow students to choose whether or not to submit standardized test scores. Some set a minimum GPA for SAT optional status. Many see it as a way of freeing themselves from the \"testing industrial complex\" as educators sometimes call it, and others as a practical way to expand their applicant pool. My quick review of news stories about it suggests this can be a way to expand the applicant pool quite considerably, quickly, and cheaply. It's worth considering. I have long been a strong critic of the test construction process behind the SAT, and I think it would be a great idea to move in this direction, so that is my bias.</p>\n<p>…agree with everything that's been said on becoming SAT optional. Indeed, becoming SAT optional feels \"very Mills\" to me. It reflects our values of inclusivity as well as our tradition of experimentation.</p>\n<p>…The timing of this could not be more perfect and I am eager to hear more from our faculty about their thoughts on this. I was honestly surprised that it wasn't already test score optional given the strength of the Liberal Arts College reputation, our penchant for being a leader and the growing and valued diversity of our student population. Most colleges have seen some significantly positive benefit to becoming test score optional and the fairtest.org website is the best information on those types of trends.\"</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"changes\">\n\t\t\t\t\tLast edited on <span class=\"odate time_1446309678 format_%25e%20%25b%20%25Y%2C%20%25H%3A%25M%7Cagohover\">31 Oct 2015 16:41</span>\n\t\t\t\t\tby <span class=\"printuser\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djjrjr\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(491186); return false;\">djjrjr</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumViewThreadModule.listeners.showHistory(event,2394906)\"><i class=\"icon-plus\"></i> Show more</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"revisions\" style=\"display: none\"></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"options\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"postReply(event,2394906)\" class=\"btn btn-primary btn-small btn-sm\">Reply</a></strong> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"togglePostOptions(event,2394906)\" class=\"btn btn-default btn-small btn-sm\">Options</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div id=\"post-options-2394906\" class=\"options\" style=\"display: none\">\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"short\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"options btn btn-default btn-mini btn-xs\" href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"togglePostFold(event,2394906)\" c=\"\">Unfold</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"title\" href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"togglePostFold(event,2394906)\">Various comments from colleagues</a> by <span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djjrjr\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(491186); return false;\"><img class=\"small\" src=\"https://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=491186&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1701719646\" alt=\"djjrjr\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=491186)\"></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djjrjr\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(491186); return false;\">djjrjr</a></span>, <span class=\"odate time_1445450602 format_%25e%20%25b%20%25Y%2C%20%25H%3A%25M%7Cagohover\">21 Oct 2015 18:03</span>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n \n                \n                \t\n\n\n        \n            </div>\n \n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n      \n    <div class=\"post-container\" id=\"fpc-2395024\">\n                      \n\t\t<div class=\"post\" id=\"post-2395024\">\n\t\t<div class=\"long\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"head\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"options\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"togglePostFold(event,2395024)\" class=\"btn btn-default btn-small btn-sm\">Fold</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"title\" id=\"post-title-2395024\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLet's list the (anticipated) benefits and (potential) costs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"printuser avatarhover\"><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djjrjr\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(491186); return false;\"><img class=\"small\" src=\"https://www.wikidot.com/avatar.php?userid=491186&amp;amp;size=small&amp;amp;timestamp=1701719646\" alt=\"djjrjr\" style=\"background-image:url(https://www.wikidot.com/userkarma.php?u=491186)\"></a><a href=\"http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/djjrjr\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.listeners.userInfo(491186); return false;\">djjrjr</a></span> <span class=\"odate time_1445467601 format_%25e%20%25b%20%25Y%2C%20%25H%3A%25M%7Cagohover\">21 Oct 2015 22:46</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"content\" id=\"post-content-2395024\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n<p>I don't think we want to make this decision or have the discussion around individuals' opinions about standardized testing or requiring or not requiring SAT scores in applications.

In a not dissimilar move, we award work-study money with no suggestion of what the work might be and the work often enough is working in a clerical position somewhere in the college.

The smart manager would realize her job is to minimize faculty work load so that faculty can teach more.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h3 id=\"toc0\"><span>Introduction</span></h3>\n<p>A few years ago my step-son had a summer internship at Facebook. He earned a princely sum and the workplace was designed around his needs. Free meals, great computer hardware, headphones, even laundry service. It seemed a pretty extravagant setup for 21 year old interns. But FB got it right - they wanted these \"kids\" to be coding and so they did everything they could to maximize the time and attention they could get them to devote to that task. FB recognized who the talent was in their business.</p>\n<p>Although it will come across as arrogant to some audiences, the faculty is the \"talent\" in the higher education operation. Or, at least it should be; in some contexts the priorities have shifted. All too often presidents, trustees, and pundits focus on the faculty as a cost center, but that's the wrong way to look at it. When we make decisions about resources, tools, and policies we should be asking ourselves what would facilitate faculty producing more of what they are good at.</p>\n<p>Sure, there are always a few members of any faculty who manage to do as little as possible for the institution, poster children for the anti-teacher cynics, but one should never design an institution or its strategies around these outliers. Instead we should take advantage of the great majority of folks who are over-dedicated to the vocation of teacher, the ones who despite lifetime earnings below comparable people in other lines of work, despite all the frustrations routinely give and give and give to the job. Any organization that has a core of employees like that should rejoice and do everything it can to make it easier for them to do more better.</p>\n<p>This project will develop a set of working principles that can be applied across the board to get more of our policies, decisions, structures, tools, and practices aligned with this outcome. It will also generate concrete do-able suggestions that can start making a difference right away.</p>",

At the same time, it has many internal parts that have almost the opposite charge: to be constantly at the cutting edge. The tension between these is not always well managed and not always a productive one.</p>\n<p>Small liberal arts colleges (SLACs), in particular, can find themselves in a bind. In an environment shouting \"adapt or die,\" many of their leaders, members, and supporters misguidedly believe their legacy is the protection of tradition. Administrators are ill-equipped to run the organization in new ways and are challenged by their faculty when they do. Administrators ill-equipped to parry well-intentioned but uninformed intrusions from trustees and thought-leaders who \"know how to run an organization\" and whose wallets guarantee them a hearing. Faculty clamor for a greater role in governance even though few of their number know anything about how to run an educational organization even in the old ways, much less new ones.</p>\n<p>It is a frightening perfect storm of not being up to the challenges we face, but buried in it may be an opportunity. The lack of managerial and entrepreneurial acumen in these precincts may make it easier for good ideas to take the helm. Much of the status quo is stuck in its ways of not doing things which may be easier to dislodge than one that is stuck in its ways of doing things.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc1\"><span>Concepts</span></h3>\n<p>No Handoffs</p>\n<p>Minimum Viable Product</p>\n<p>Fail Fast, Fail Cheap</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc2\"><span>Rapid Prototyping</span></h4>\n<p>The term refers to the practice in manufacturing industries whereby a mockup or model of a part, device, or product is created using tools like 3D printing, woodworking, modeling clay, or even paper folding. The goal is to get design concepts into sufficiently realistic physical form so that designers and users can interact with it to generate ideas that will help to refine it in successive iterations.</p>\n<p>In the higher education environment this usually means a whole sketch of an idea can be generated so that colleagues and students can try it out and offer feedback.</p>\n<p>The main lesson for educational institutions is the need for tools and skills that allow us to take ideas we are considering and prototype them. The goal is to strike a balance between the rapidity with which this can be done and the verisimilitude of the prototype.

Our responsibility as teachers, after all, is to add something to each of the students we work with.</p>\n<p>But let's think for a bit about the activity that is at the center of the assessment of student learning: measuring learning as an outcome of teaching.</p>\n<p>Suppose for a moment that how much a student learns in a given course is a function of the quality of the teaching (T) with some contributions from the student's level of preparation (P), innate capacity (C), and availability to actually study, come to class, etc. (A).</p>\n<p>Let's imagine that on some normalized scale 0.6 of each of these produces a satisfactory level of learning. We choose this on the assumption that being \"average\" should suffice and that average for folks who are actually in college should be a little above the population average (we're assuming that these variables are normally distributed with mean 0.5).</p>\n<p>Now let's make a fairly conservative set of guess about the relative contribution of each. Let's imagine that the quality of the teaching determines 70% of the learning, with preparation, capacity, and availability each contributing 10%. Further let's assume that most of the students we are looking at vary +/1&nbsp;0.2 from the mean (that is, preparation varies between 0.4 and 0.8, etc.).</p>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:measuring-learning/distribution-of-teachers-and-learners.png\" alt=\"distribution-of-teachers-and-learners.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<span class=\"equation-number\">(1)</span>\n<div class=\"math-equation\" id=\"equation-1\">\\begin{align} learning=0.7 \\times TEACHING + 0.1 \\times PREPARATION + 0.1 \\times CAPACITY + 0.1 \\times AVAILABILITY \\end{align}</div>",

We schedule classes so that students are meeting at the same time on different campuses; my students participate via video when Jamie teaches and as do her students when I teach. I'm in the classroom for both courses at my end and Jamie at her end. She assesses the work in social psych and I assess the work in methods, but we provide face-to-face feedback for our own students. We estimate the added workload of the remote class is maybe 25%, and the work of being the remote assistant for the other instructor's course is maybe 25%. Thus, each of us teaches 44 students at our home institution with about 75% of the effort. The students get a better designed course, interact with two instructors and a wider diversity of students.

A family with an annual income of about 50,000 is expected to be able to pay about 6% of that for college.</p>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:price-points-and-reality/EFC-2012-13.png\" alt=\"EFC-2012-13.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.stratagee.com/resources/efc_quick_reference/1213_efc_quick_reference.html\">http://www.stratagee.com/resources/efc_quick_reference/1213_efc_quick_reference.html</a></p>\n<p>We can combine these two by identifying the EFC for the various points on the income distribution plot.</p>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:price-points-and-reality/fam-inc-and-EFC-2012.png\" alt=\"fam-inc-and-EFC-2012.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<p>What can we learn from this? If we superimpose a line representing the total cost of attendance we see that there are very few families out there who can simply write a check for the full cost of attendance.

At the module level? And then by implication at the syllabus level? In other words, a committed change in a module could trigger a commit at the syllabus level? Could also do a change at syllabus level by changing order of modules in a syllabus.</p>\n<p>OR, a given version of a syllabus simply points to a particular version of a module. If you want to update a syllabus with the new version of a module then you have to say so explicitly?</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc2\"><span>Feedback</span></h4>\n<p>One of the most onerous tasks for faculty and possibly the most valuable service for learners is feedback on student work. It is the single most scale dependent component of a teacher's work load. To date, about the most advanced application of technology to this problem is the electronic grade book, a primitive software implementation of an age old paper tool.</p>\n<p>Some features we will explore:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mention of an assignment in a syllabus creates an entry in the gradebook</li>\n<li>Mention of an assignment in a syllabus creates an instance of an assignment object. An assignment object has\n<ol>\n<li>descriptive elements (instructions, etc.),</li>\n<li>capacity for students to annotate instructions</li>\n<li>resource elements (texts, videos, etc.),</li>\n<li>a sandbox (where student work can be done, possibly with instructor intervention),</li>\n<li>a submission mechanism,</li>\n<li>a feedback mechanism.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 id=\"toc3\"><span>\"Learning Goals\"</span></h4>\n<p>Thinking about \"learning goals.\" Problem: usually they are too vague and abstract. The reason is that an instructor (or someone else) is asked to summarize what students get out of a course in a few rhetorically constrained statements.</p>\n<p>Not sure of the correct term for it, but I don't think people are good at abstract aggregations in the absence of explicit enumeration of elements. Relatedly, I suspect we have a hard time staying at the same level of abstraction as we generate new items in the absence of the members or elements being conceptually aggregated. Perhaps see literature on pilesorts<sup class=\"footnoteref\"><a id=\"footnoteref-1\" href=\"javascript:;\" class=\"footnoteref\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')\">1</a></sup>?</p>\n<p>At the same time, we are trying to get out of thinking of learning only in terms of (semester-length) courses.</p>\n<p>One might be tempted to start thinking along these lines:</p>\n<p>Skills &gt; Skillsets &gt; Course &gt; Program</p>\n<p>That is, we might see course 1 having skills a, b, and c while course 2 teaches skills d, e, and f like this:</p>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:images/skillsets01.png\" alt=\"skillsets01.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<p>In reality, it's much more likely that we will get something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:images/skillsets02.png\" alt=\"skillsets02.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<p>Which is to say, a given skill is not likely to be restricted to a single course and this doesn't just mean that a skill is \"introduced\" in one course and \"practiced\" in another.</p>\n<h4 id=\"toc4\"><span>A Hierarchy of Learning</span></h4>\n<p>The activity of teaching and the process of learning happen across a wide range of levels more or less all at once. We learn a keyboard shortcut as a part of how to work with pivot tables. Pivot tables are one skill in a basic Excel data tools skill set which would be one component of a unit on learning to handle 2 dimensional data. And that unit on 2 dimensional data might be a part of a module on basic statistics and data analysis which might be a part of a course on research methods in a program on social research (where the learning goal was something like \"mastering basic tools of quantitative analysis\").</p>\n<p>Microskills<br>\nSkills<br>\nSkill sets<br>\nLearning unit goals<br>\nLearning module goals<br>\nCourse goals<br>\nProgram goals</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes-footer\">\n<div class=\"title\">Footnotes</div>\n<div class=\"footnote-footer\" id=\"footnote-1\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnoteref-1')\">1</a>. <a href=\"http://anthrostrategy.com/2011/08/06/pile-sorting-techniques-for-ethnographers/\">Pile Sorting Techniques for Ethnographers</a>, <a href=\"http://medanth.wikispaces.com/Pile+Sorting\">Pile Sorting</a> on the MedAnth wiki, <a href=\"http://petergiovannini.com/ethnobotany-methods/how-to-pile-sorting-with-anthropac-tutorial.html\">How to carry out pile sorting and how to analyse the data with Anthropac: a tutorial</a></div>\n</div>",

But are there ways to restructure and innovate to create institutions that provide the same or better educational outcomes employing faculty in the same favorable circumstances as at present but do so for, say, half the cost? I think this is less pie-in-the-sky than those projects that challenge architects to produce $5,000 houses or $200 laptops that can transform the developing world. It will require a lot of ingenuity, but we have a lot of the pieces already up and running.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"image-container floatleft\"><img src=\"http://djjr-courses.wikidot.com/local--files/major21:images/documents-thumb.png\" alt=\"documents-thumb.png\" class=\"image\"></div>\n<h3><span><a href=\"/major21:price-points-and-reality\">Price Points And Reality: Smart Targets for 2020</a></span></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If one looks realistically at the US income distribution, financial aid, and the \"expected family contribution\" on which financial aid is based, what should target price point be for SLACs?

When liberal arts education works, it transforms the student. Or, more accurately, students transform themselves. How do we facilitate that process?</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<p>One place it happens is in academic advising when the student and faculty advisor reflect together on the student's progress and program. A tool for advising that I have found helpful for implementing the idea that in the final analysis students are responsible for their own transformation is the LEARNING CONTRACT.</p>\n<p>The contract has four parts: goals, academic activities, other activities, and criteria for evaluation.</p>\n<p>Students fill out a contract at the start of each semester. They discuss its content with their advisor and then both sign off on it. It becomes the basis for their conversations throughout the semester and for the student's optional self evaluation at semester's end.</p>\n<p>In the goals section the student records the current state of long and short term goals. By long term goals we mean \"what do you want to be when you grow up?\" and by short term we mean this semester: Why these courses and activities? How do you want to be different as a result of this work?</p>\n<p>The academic activities section is just the list of courses being taken for credit.</p>\n<p>In the \"other activities section\" the student lists what else is going on in their life this semester. Where and how much are they working? What are they doing for fun and stress relief? What are they doing that's a source of stress?</p>\n<p>I take pains to make very explicit the idea that the point of this section is for us both to acknowledge that education and the transformation we aspire to does not happen in a vacuum. Some students use this section mainly as a listing of extra curricular activities; others use it to answer the more personal question: \"what do you wish your teachers and advisors knew about you?\"</p>\n<p>Finally, the last section is \"criteria for evaluation.\" I describe this quite simply: by what criteria will we judge this semester to have been a success?\" Sometimes it's mundane: \"3 As and a B.\" Other times more about personal development, \"make demonstrated progress on conquering my procrastination problem,\" or moving plans along: \"deciding on a major.\" Sometimes, during a first semester at Mills it's just \"get used to being here and figuring out whether it's for me.\"</p>\n<p>How do we use the contract? At the start of the semester the student brings a completed contract to our first 20 minute or so meeting. Sometimes we'll negotiate over some parts. I might suggest that the grade expectations are not ambitious enough or even that they might not be realistic given a particular set of courses. Or, based on our conversation I might wonder whether these really are the right criteria for THIS semester.</p>\n<p>Then, during the semester we see each other two or three time and the contract provides a framework for our subsequent conversations. How are the near term goals working out? How is each course? Are the other activities adding or subtracting stress? Do we look to be on target to meet our criteria?</p>\n<p>In my experience - both as a student and an advisor - the learning contract provides students with a reflective structure oriented toward taking responsibility for one's own education and for constructing that education AS transformation rather than mere accumulation of credits. It promotes meaningful and systematic advisor-advisee communication. It allows me to to advise both more effectively and more efficiently. With first years it helps me orient them toward taking their education seriously and thinking beyond ticking off requirements. For transfers, it signals a definitive shift from the drive-by advising they may have known - and become cynical about - at previous institutions.</p>\n<p>And it makes me a better advisor ensuring that I cover the same ground with advisees regardless of how talkative or reticent they are; it keeps us focused on their long term educational trajectory rather than getting bogged down in rules and credits and thereby it makes advising more fun and rewarding than it is when we allow record keeping and clerical aspects of advising to dominate.</p>\n<p>Learning by Contract: good for the advisee, good for the advisor.</p>",

In order for it to make sense to ask TTT faculty to \"do more\" we have to assume some combination of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>TTT faculty work hard and full time (say 40 hours per week on average) but the institution needs everyone to chip in by doing more, OR</li>\n<li>TTT faculty, in a word, shirk, and, on average, can afford to work a little harder, OR</li>\n<li>TTT faculty do other things (advising and research and service) that they could do less of so that they could do more teaching, OR</li>\n<li>TTT faculty do not work as \"smart\" as they might.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The reality is almost certainly a mix of these, but let's keep these in mind as we examine the idea of becoming more efficient by increasing teaching loads.</p>\n<h5 id=\"toc1\"><span>What's the Profile?</span></h5>\n<p>Many institutions start with a profile for faculty positions that suggests the proportional deployment of their time between teaching, research, and service.

At my own institution, I would estimate our expectation to be around 75:15:10 with advising understood as a part of teaching not service.

At this rate, the underutilized instructor teaching a 5 course load dedicates 2.5 x 7.5h + 3.75h = 22.5 per week to teaching.</p>\n<p>So, raising the teaching load from 5 to 7 courses per year is a no brainer if the average TTT faculty member is devoting only about 7.5 hours per week to each course she teaches.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-1\" style=\"display:none\">\n<h4 id=\"toc3\"><span>Speeding Up the Line</span></h4>\n<p>If instructors ARE already working 40 hours, maybe we can achieve a productivity increase by teaching faster. A simple analogy is speeding up the assembly line in a factory. In the time one used to do a certain amount of service, research, and teaching we will expect faculty to now do the same service and research but more teaching. What's the impact on students?</p>\n<p>If we teach 5 courses and advise as our teaching load now and this represents 75% of our appointment, then we spend 10 hours per course per week. Three of these hours are contact hours, 7 are for prep and evaluation (let's assume a 50:50 split of these).</p>\n<p>Over the course of the semester all students get 15 x 3 contact hours and the benefit of 15 x 3.5 prep hours = about 98 hours of \"instructional effort.\" If we assume enrollment of 20, each student also receives a slice of the evaluation time: 15 x 3.5 / 20 = about 2&nbsp;1/2 hours of an instructor's time/attention.</p>\n<p>If we switch to 7 courses, instructors will speed up to 7.5 hours on each course. If 3 of these are still contact hours then the students get 15 x 3 + 15 x 2.25 = about 89 hours of instructional effort and 15 x 2.25 / 20 = 1.7 hours of evaluation and feedback.</p>\n<p>These represent a 10% drop in the time an instructor devotes to the overall class and a 35% drop in the amount of feedback, individual consultation, and evaluation students will receive.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-2\" style=\"display:none\">\n<h4 id=\"toc4\"><span>Better Tools and Working Smarter</span></h4>\n<p>Another possibility is that instructors are just not working smart. There might be ways to teach more efficiently that would make it possible to teach 7 courses per year with the same total investment of time and effort that it takes to teach 5 courses per year.</p>\n<p>What would it take?</p>\n<h5 id=\"toc5\"><span>Better Tools</span></h5>\n<p>An institution could also invest in better tools.</p>\n<p>Under the assumptions above, I will need to spend 3.75 hours on advising instead of 5 so I will need tools that allow me to be about 25% more efficient in that task.</p>\n<p>To accomplish what was 7 hours of prep and feedback in 4.5 hours I will need new tools and practices that allow me to be about 35% more efficient in those tasks.</p>\n<p>Almost nobody is talking about tools that really help instructors to teach more, better, and easier. In fact, we introduce almost every year tools and practices that shift more and more clerical tasks to the job of instructors and advisors to achieve labor savings among lower salaried employees.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-3\" style=\"display:none\">\n<h4 id=\"toc6\"><span>Teachers Should Just Teach</span></h4>\n<p>Maybe the right way to think about this is to shift instructional faculty away from a profile that includes research and service. Under current assumptions, what would this get us?</p>\n<p>If I am currently working 40 hours under a 75:15:10 profile and you switch me to a 100:0:0 profile and other things are held constant, what do we get? The ten hours I previously devoted to research and service are now available for teaching. Under the 5 course scenario I used 10 hours for each course and 5 for advising. Under the new scenario I can offer 3.5 courses per semester with the same 10 hours per course and the same 5 hours for advising.</p>\n<p>This shift in profile will accomplish increased instructional efficiency AND make institutional governance more efficient by removing instructional faculty from that realm.</p>\n<p>Benefit: up to $1.5m in reduced instructional cost. Additionally, full time instructors willing to work under these conditions might be less expensive and the institution could move away from cumbersome promotion systems based on measures other than teaching.</p>\n<p>Balancing the benefits to institution are costs such as reduced flexibility/breadth in course offerings; need to increase size of administration to accomplish what was previously provided by faculty service; possible prestige hit by switch to non-research faculty; recruitment costs to replace faculty who leave; enrollment impact as ranking/reputation slip.</p>\n<h5 id=\"toc7\"><span>Dump Advising</span></h5>\n<p>One possibility is to simply off-load some tasks. Advising, for example. So, let's have all academic advising done by student affairs professionals. Using our 40 hour, 5 course, 75:15:10 assumptions, this frees up 5 hours per week - over two semesters enough for an additional course.</p>\n<p>The savings represented by this move might be as much as 3/4 million dollars. If we assume 100 advisees per advising professional we could accomplish this by hiring maybe 10 student affairs staff and one manager at, say, 40k and 60k respectively, for total cost with benefits of under 550k.</p>\n<p>Net is shift resources from faculty to student life, reduce academic content of advising, reduce student-faculty contact (which research has shown to be a high impact practice -little if any research siting positive educational benefits from more student life contact). Increased incidence of \"what does the teacher want\" when advising is done by non-faculty.</p>\n<p>It is unclear how to reckon the reputation all and other pedagogical costs of decrease in faculty contact or academic content in advising. Further research needed on that.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-4\" style=\"display:none\">\n<h4 id=\"toc8\"><span>We All Work Harder</span></h4>\n<p>The simplest scenario is to assume that institutional sustainability can only be achieved by asking people to work more - we can be agnostic about how much or little people are working now - but if we can get some employees to work more hours then we can shed other employees.</p>\n<p>Assume we want the same types of classes, the same level of research, professional accomplishment, and service from faculty, but we want, say, 7 instead of 5 classes per year. Presumably the savings come from hiring fewer part-time instructors; a small institution might realize a savings of up to 1.5 million dollars, maybe 10-15% of instructional compensation cost, with this 30-40% increase in instructional work time.</p>\n<p>The non-instructional compensation cost is a slightly larger part of the budget so the savings might be even more on that side if the increase in instructional work can be accompanied by a similar increase in non-instructional staff work time. This could be implemented by having other employees add 12-16 hours to current working week. Employees might have the option to choose a work day that will shift from 9:00am-5:00pm to 8:00am - 7:00pm or to work 9 to 5 seven days a week. Assuming these extra hours would be able to cover the work of other employees, such a change would permit a small institution to move from, say, to cut up to a quarter of its work force saving perhaps 2 to 5 million annually.</p>\n<p>Note that on both the instructional and non-instructional side - maybe more on the latter - reduction in number of employees also increases efficiency by reducing managerial workload.</p>\n<p>If an institution has the wherewithal to handle the transaction costs, this plan could be individualized to take into account who is already working long hours, acknowledging that some folks are already performing a large amount of \"uncompensated\" work and exempt them from an increase but expecting the others to work up to the same level. In non-union factories this approach is sometimes used to reduce wages by setting piece rates according to the highest output workers and offering incentives to \"rate busters\" to keep the numbers high.</p>\n<p>These customizations will, of course, blunt the efficiency effect that motivates the change both by reducing the uptake and those transaction costs. But the bigger worry is that when you make people work that much more the usual result is a loss of quality which can be expected to reduce demand - in this case, enrollment.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is we need to be very rigorous about the costs of our cost-cutting.</p>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:tweak-teaching-load/7courses-56hours.png\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/major21:tweak-teaching-load/7courses-56hours.png/medium.jpg\" alt=\"7courses-56hours.png\" class=\"image\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:tweak-teaching-load/7courses-56hoursb.png\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/major21:tweak-teaching-load/7courses-56hoursb.png/medium.jpg\" alt=\"7courses-56hoursb.png\" class=\"image\"></a></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-5\" style=\"display:none\">\n<h4 id=\"toc9\"><span>Not a New Business Model</span></h4>\n<p>One reason an institution might change the teaching load of full time faculty is to wean itself off adjunct faculty. Over-dependence on adjunct faculty has become a common business model in American higher education. It is a model that hides an unsustainable situation - unable to attract sufficient enrollment to its programs, an institution develops a menagerie of programs (often graduate and professional degrees) that can be staffed \"just hiring a few adjuncts while we get the program off the ground.\" If the instructional costs are low enough, any revenue is good revenue and so these programs proliferate and remain immune to close financial scrutiny.</p>\n<p>In those circumstances, one can say that adjunct labor IS the business model. When these places consider increasing teaching load so as to need fewer adjuncts they are not changing their business model at all. They are simply asking the full time faculty to do for free what the adjunct faculty were previously doing for a low wage.</p>\n<p>The resulting apparent savings do the real harm of obscuring even more the fundamentally unsustainable program mix the school is trying to recruit students to.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-6\" style=\"display:none\">\n<h4 id=\"toc10\"><span>Assessment Should Track Deployment</span></h4>\n<p>If an institution is going to deploy its instructional workforce on the basis of some T:R:S ratio, it should probably evaluate these individuals using the same proportions. The implications of this are simple: a promotion and tenure committee should give a person a score on research productivity, teaching, and service and these should then be weighted by the numbers in the TRS profile. A standard could be set: each to be evaluated relative to the rest of the college, for example, and some bar would be set that took into account the relative importance of the factors based on how we deploy people's time. But the traditional foregrounding of research productivity and disciplinary visibility is completely out of line in an institution with a high teaching load. It is organizationally stupid as it retains and rewards those who prioritize things other than what the institution does. It is ethically dubious because it rewards privilege and sends mixed messages.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"wiki-tab-0-7\" style=\"display:none\">\n<h4 id=\"toc11\"><span>What Is Your Brand?</span></h4>\n<p>How does an institution pitch itself to prospective students, donors, and others? If that brand identity includes attention, personalization, and faculty interaction, the decrease in these outputs has to be figured in the savings. One trend in mass higher education is to reduce the \"personal\" on the instructional side and replace it with \"personal\" on the academic support and student services side.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n//<![CDATA[\nOZONE.dom.onDomReady(function(){\n        var tabView453fa5cb631265d0a5a04fbe0644eb31 = new YAHOO.widget.TabView('wiki-tabview-453fa5cb631265d0a5a04fbe0644eb31');\n                }, \"dummy-ondomready-block\");\n        \n//]]>\n</script>\n<hr>\n<div style=\"background-color: beige;\">\n<h3 id=\"toc12\"><span>Talk/Comments/Feedback</span></h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"comments-box\">\n\t\t\n\t<div class=\"options\" id=\"comments-options-hidden\" style=\"display: none\">\n\t\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumCommentsModule.listeners.showComments(event)\">Show Comments</a> \n\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t<div id=\"thread-container\" class=\"thread-container\" style=\"margin-top: 1em\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\tWIKIDOT.forumThreadId = 1924409;\n</script>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"thread-container-posts\" style=\"display: none\">\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n</div>\n\n        <a href=\"javascript:;\" id=\"new-post-button\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumViewThreadModule.listeners.newPost(event,null)\" style=\"display:  block ; margin-bottom:1em\">Add a New Comment</a>\n\n \n\n<div style=\"display:none\" id=\"post-options-template\">\n\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumViewThreadModule.listeners.showPermalink(event,'%POST_ID%')\" class=\"btn btn-default btn-small btn-sm\">Permanent Link</a>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumViewThreadModule.listeners.editPost(event,'%POST_ID%')\" class=\"btn btn-default btn-small btn-sm\">Edit</a>\n\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"WIKIDOT.modules.ForumViewThreadModule.listeners.deletePost(event,'%POST_ID%')\" class=\"btn btn-danger btn-small btn-sm\">Delete</a>\n</div>\n\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n\t\n\t\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"toc13\"><span>See Also</span></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Female Science Professor. 2007. <a href=\"http://science-professor.blogspot.com/2007/05/research-teaching-service.html\">Research : Teaching : Service</a></li>\n<li>NCES. 1998. \"<a href=\"http://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/98002.pdf\">Teaching workload of full-time postsecondary faculty</a>\" in <em>The Condition of Education, 1997.</em></li>\n<li>Webber, Karen L. 2011. \"<a href=\"http://ihe.uga.edu/uploads/publications/faculty/Webber_Chp6_MeasuringFacProd.pdf\">Measuring Faculty Productivity</a>\" chapter 6 in Shin, et al.

    "title": "Use \"Merit\" Aid to Connect Students to Faculty in Research",
    "content": "<p>Merit aid is rightly controversial but \"everybody does it.\" In its current form we rely almost entirely on its pecuniary qualities. There is an emotional component insofar as a student feels recognized for her achievements, but mostly we expect it to have positive yield consequences because it lowers the cost of attendance beyond what need-based aid accomplishes. In a not dissimilar move, we award work-study money with no suggestion of what the work might be and the work often enough is working in a clerical position somewhere in the college. WHY NOT exploit the relational and identity dimensions by attaching this aid to a concrete programmatic offering. Example: \"We would also like to offer you a $4,000 fellowship to participate in our first year \"Innovation Exploration\" program or \"Our offer also includes a $3,000 research assistantship you can apply after your first year to work as a research assistant to a professor.\"</p>\n<p>This is a gigantic underutilization of the leverage value of these resources. Why not dedicate part of what we call merit aid and work-study to targeted designations and programmatic features of the college. Rather than a letter that says \"we would like to offer you an additional $4,000 and call you a \"dean's scholar,\" we write one that says \"based on our reading of your application we would like to invite you to be a part of a new program at Mills, the \"Social Innovation Corps\" or the \"Student-Faculty Research Collaborative\" or the \"Mills Oakland Urban Research Partnership.\" We then structure something like an LLC around these and deploy some part of an intro course to the project, etc.</p>\n<p>Another possibility is to offer students a \"research fellowship\" which would designate them as a faculty research assistant from day 1. The letter could give them a choice based on a number of faculty who have expressed interest in them based on their record. We faculty would work together to coordinate a good experience and ways of cross training students so that it was actually helpful rather than just more work supervising.</p>\n<p>All of these things could be done in random experiments to see if they are effective. Example: we identify candidates in the admissions pool and then randomly make the offer to some and then we track the yield on the two groups. Alternatively, we could do this further upstream - perhaps when inquiries are first made we follow up with an introduction to a program like this - \"based on your profile we thought you might be interested in being considered for this program at Mills\" - and then we see what our conversion rate is for those we do this for and those we do not.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://mills-stratplan-g1.blogspot.com/2013/01/resources-for-student-participation-in.html\">item in Strat Plan working group blog</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>THE LATEST</strong></p>\n<div class=\"list-pages-box\">    \n\n<span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:bottomup-program-fte-deployment\">BottomUp Program FTE Deployment</a> |</span><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:preparing-for-free-community-college\">Preparing for Free Community College</a> |</span><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:who-can-afford-us\">Who Can Afford a SLAC Education?</a> |</span><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:merit-aid-students-faculty-research\">Use \"Merit\" Aid to Connect Students to Faculty in Research</a> |</span><span style=\"font-size:0.8em;\">| <a href=\"/major21:shatter-the-semester\">Shatter the Semester</a> |</span><br>\n\n    \n    \n    \n    </div>\n<hr>",

Faculty should beware, though, of the trend at Wellesley shown in the final two images: the president has cut back her work hours by about 14% and this resulted in an increase in faculty workload of about 70%!</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><strong>San Rafael</strong><br>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/dominican.png\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/dominican.png/medium.jpg\" alt=\"dominican.png\" class=\"image\"></a></div>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Portland</strong><br>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/lewisandclarke.png\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/lewisandclarke.png/medium.jpg\" alt=\"lewisandclarke.png\" class=\"image\"></a></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Oakland</strong><br>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/mills.png\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/mills.png/medium.jpg\" alt=\"mills.png\" class=\"image\"></a></div>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Belmont</strong><br>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/notredame.png\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/notredame.png/medium.jpg\" alt=\"notredame.png\" class=\"image\"></a></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Claremont</strong><br>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/scripps.png\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/scripps.png/medium.jpg\" alt=\"scripps.png\" class=\"image\"></a></div>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Moraga</strong><br>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/stmarys.png\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/stmarys.png/medium.jpg\" alt=\"stmarys.png\" class=\"image\"></a></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Wellesley 2010</strong><br>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/wellesley2010.png\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/wellesley2010.png/medium.jpg\" alt=\"wellesley2010.png\" class=\"image\"></a></div>\n</td>\n<td><strong>Wellesley 2012</strong><br>\n<div class=\"image-container aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/wellesley2012.png\"><img src=\"https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/major21:working-hours-and-the-21st-century-college/wellesley2012.png/medium.jpg\" alt=\"wellesley2012.png\" class=\"image\"></a></div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>",

This should be live on the web at all times for students, advisors, faculty, department heads. A bonus would be to have instructors assigned as they are known.
