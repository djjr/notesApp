The data suggests that about 75% of the youth in Ourtown are "good kids" who would benefit from the alternative program and 25% are "bad kids" who will not.  Your supervisor also says you should come up with some more acceptable terms than "good" and "bad." It turns out that when a kid is, in fact, "bad," the test gets it right 90% of the time, wrong 10%.  But when the kid is, in fact, "good," the test says "bad" 30% of the time.12. Sketch an event tree that captures this and then flip the tree to evaluate the test and provide guidance on how to interpret its results.  ',

These results suggest that this test is solid when it indicates a "good" kid -- only 5% of the time will it give a [[[false positive]]].  On the other hand, when the test indicates a negative result it is right only half the time.Our policy suggestion, then, would probably be to accept positive test results, but to refer negative results for a more in-depth investigation.'},

        'soln': '<h3>SOLUTION</h3>We assume we are spending $25,000 "at a time," at each step choosing the next available opportunity with the highest marginal net benefit.  Before we have done anything at all the best first investment is in the after school program which promises a MNB of 0.6 at that point.  After that investment\'s been made, the best available opportunity is another "dose" of the same program.  In going from a $25k program to a $50k program it promises MNB of 0.8.  We continue two more investments of $25k in this program as they are still higher MNB than the next best (which is an initial investment in police or evening programs, both of which have MNB of 0.5).  Thus, steps 1 through 4 are after school.Technically we could go for either policing or evening program here.  Our options?  We can choose one or the other but we notice that the sequence that follows depends on which one.  Since the next investments in police offer higher MNB, you could argue that we should just start with police (this would allow us to follow a rule of "maximize NB all along the way").  Or, perhaps the better decision is "both" -- that is, our 5th and 6th investments would be to get started with police and evening programs.  Each of these is arguable.  Here we\'ll choose the option that says start with police since it offers the higher immediately following opportunities. (in practice this approach does not always work as a fail safe, step-by-step program: faced with funky up and down MNB curves that we don\'t know how far down we will get, we\'d probably do a systematic comparison of different scenarios)Thus, the next three investments (#5, #6, #7) are police.  Then the next opportunities are after school (MNB=0.25), police (MNB=0.4), and evening program (MNB=0.5).  Thus, the 8th investment is is evening program.At this point, the best next investments are the evening program.  And for the next three steps -- which exhaust our $300k budget -- this is the best program to invest in.

The **topology** (what is connected to what) is the same as above but this layout makes it appear that VP1 is at the middle of the organization -- the four people on either side have to go through her and this might make her some sort of "gatekeeper."  https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files//q:0025/ch01-ex01-04.gifBut we\'ve left something out.  The vertical dimension in a "normal" organizational chart implies a relationship of "gives orders to" or "takes orders from" or "is the supervisor of" or "is the subordinate of."  Each of these is an **asymmetric relationship** and the network (graph) they produce is a **directed** one (also known as a directed graph or **digraph**).  In NodeXL we can switch the type of the graph in the graph panel of the NodeXL ribbon.  To make the lines and arrows easier to see we go to the edges worksheet and then use the edgewidth button in the visual properties panel.https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files//q:0025/ch01-ex01-05.gifDownload the [[file /q:0025/chapter01-exercise01-orgchart.xlsx| NodeXL file]] here.'},
