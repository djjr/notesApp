**[[size larger]][[[Q:0001| Q1]]][[/size]]** In connection with a program that provides alternatives for youth who have a run in with the criminal justice system, a colleague mentions that the program could be more effective if there were an easy way to predict who might benefit from the alternative program.  The data suggests that about 75% of the youth in Ourtown are "good kids" who would benefit from the alternative program and 25% are "bad kids" who will not.  Your supervisor also says you should come up with some more acceptable terms than "good" and "bad." 

It turns out that when a kid is, in fact, "bad," the test gets it right 90% of the time, wrong 10%.  But when the kid is, in fact, "good," the test says "bad" 30% of the time.12. Sketch an event tree that captures this and then flip the tree to evaluate the test and provide guidance on how to interpret its results.

##green|First we set up the [[[event tree]]] to represent the information we have in hand -- what the test can tell us if we already know the reality.  The "reality" node is to the left and the "test" nodes are to the right.  The known probabilities are assigned to the different branches.## 
[[image q:0001/tree-flip-solution-00.gif]]
##green|Next we flip the tree -- not worrying about the numbers at first.##
[[image q:0001/tree-flip-solution-01.gif]]
##green|Then we transfer the path probabilities from the right end of the paths in the original tree to the corresponding paths in the flipped tree.##
[[image q:0001/tree-flip-solution-02.gif]]
##green|Next we add up all the probability that comes off the top branch of the new test node -- the path probabilities on the two upper branches.  And then repeat for the lower test branch.##
[[image q:0001/tree-flip-solution-03.gif]]
##green|Finally, we calculate the probabilities coming off the R nodes.  What numbers would produce the given path probabilities given the computed test probabilities (in green) from step 2?  The formula is [[$ \frac {path probability} {test probability} $]]##
[[image q:0001/tree-flip-solution-04.gif]]
##green|If we agree to talk about the test as detecting "good" kids who will benefit from the alternative program then we would say that a "positive" test result is when the test says a kid is "good."  These results suggest that this test is solid when it indicates a "good" kid -- only 5% of the time will it give a [[[false positive]]].  On the other hand, when the test indicates a negative result it is right only half the time.##

##green|Our policy suggestion, then, would probably be to accept positive test results, but to refer negative results for a more in-depth investigation.##

> "The officer in charge of a United States Embassy recreation program has decided to replenish the employees club funds by arranging a dinner. It rains nine days out of ten at the post and he must decide whether to hold the dinner indoors or out. An enclosed pavilion is available but uncomfortable, and past experience has shown turnout to be low at indoor functions, resulting in a 60 per cent chance of gaining $100 from a dinner held in the pavilion and a 40 per cent chance of losing $20. On the other hand, an outdoor dinner could be expected to earn $500 unless it rains, in which case the dinner would lose about $10" (Stokey & Zeckhauser 1977, 202).

##green|We assume we are spending $25,000 "at a time," at each step choosing the next available opportunity with the highest marginal net benefit.  Before we have done anything at all the best first investment is in the after school program which promises a MNB of 0.6 at that point.  After that investment's been made, the best available opportunity is another "dose" of the same program.  In going from a $25k program to a $50k program it promises MNB of 0.8.  We continue two more investments of $25k in this program as they are still higher MNB than the next best (which is an initial investment in police or evening programs, both of which have MNB of 0.5).  Thus, steps 1 through 4 are after school.##

##green|Technically we could go for either policing or evening program here.  Our options?  We can choose one or the other but we notice that the sequence that follows depends on which one.  Since the next investments in police offer higher MNB, you could argue that we should just start with police (this would allow us to follow a rule of "maximize NB all along the way").  Or, perhaps the better decision is "both" -- that is, our 5th and 6th investments would be to get started with police and evening programs.  Each of these is arguable.  Here we'll choose the option that says start with police since it offers the higher immediately following opportunities. (in practice this approach does not always work as a fail safe, step-by-step program: faced with funky up and down MNB curves that we don't know how far down we will get, we'd probably do a systematic comparison of different scenarios)##

##green|Thus, the next three investments (#5, #6, #7) are police.  Then the next opportunities are after school (MNB=0.25), police (MNB=0.4), and evening program (MNB=0.5).  Thus, the 8th investment is is evening program.##

##green|At this point, the best next investments are the evening program.  And for the next three steps -- which exhaust our $300k budget -- this is the best program to invest in.  All these are shown below.##

**[[[q:0006]]].** It's the end of the semester and it's time to optimize.  I have a sociology final exam and a public policy final exam on the same day and I can only allocate 16 hours total to exam preparation.
I estimate that if I do not study at all, I'll get C- in public policy and a C+ in sociology.  But, experience has shown that studying pays off.  In sociology, each hour of study raises my grade by 1/3 (0.33) of a letter grade (C- to C, for example).  In public policy, the payoffs are not as quick: each 2 hours yields 1/3 of a letter grade (0.167 grade per hour).
Thus, 3 hours of sociology study would take me from C+ to B+
||C||> 1 hour > ||B-||> 1 hour > ||B||> 1 hour > ||B+||
Our plans are subject to a number of constraints:
* There is a four hour public policy study session planned with the professor and it would be unwise and impolitic not to attend.  Thus, PPOL hours has to be at least 4.
* Since the top grade is A, sociology will top out at 5 study hours since these will take me from C+…B-…B…B+…A-…A and in public policy my max is correspondingly 14 with each 2 hours taking me one grade of the seven steps from C- to A.
* Total study hours must be 16 or less.
* Since I am a public policy major, I feel strongly that I have to study more for PPOL than for SOCIOLOGY
I translate these into five inequalities
* (Only 16 hours )     PPOL = -SOC + 16
* (More PPOL than SOCIOLOGY)     PPOL ≥ SOC
* (PPOL Study Group)     PPOL ≥ 4
* (SOCIOLOGY max)     SOC ≤ 5
* (PPOL max)     PPOL ≤ 14
I want to know how to divide my study time so as to maximize my grades.  Let's start with a typical Excel layout for a simple LP problem.
[[=image /q:0006/LP-setup-1.gif]]
[[=image /q:0006/LP-chart-01.gif]]
Identify the lines in this chart, indicate the feasible set, and find the optimal value of the variables and the resulting value of the objective function.
[[iftags _showsolutions]]
[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[image /q:0006/LP-chart-02.gif]]
We can identify the optimum by sketching the "iso-lines" for the objective function and noting which vertex of the feasible set touches the highest objective function value.  Or we can use solver to compute the maximum.  Or, if we have to do it by hand we can proceed systematically as follows:
# Solution will be at a vertex of feasible set: (0,14), (2,14), (5,11), (5,5), (4,4), or 0,4)
# Some of these can be ruled out as they are clearly dominated by another option
 * (2,14) > (0,14)
 * (5,11) > (5,5) > (4,4) > (0,4)
# And so we just need to compute the objective function for (2,14) and (5,11)
 * grade_boost(2,14) = 0.333*2 + 0.167*14 = 3.0
 * grade_boost(5,11) = 0.333*5 + 0.167*11 = 3.5

Would Durkheim expect deviance to arise in this group? How so? What kind?

[[iftags _showsolutions]]
[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
Durkheim argued that deviance is inevitable in any society – even one in which all members are carefully chosen. Eventually someone will step slightly out of bounds of the accepted norms and be seen as deviant. In this political group, someone will have a slightly different point of view that will cause either his/her dismissal, or a split into new factions (B00205201)

Durkheim regarded crime as normal because it has existed in every society and in every stage of society's development. It serves many purposes and cannot be eradicated. A group screening members may provide their organization w/a relatively similar set of norms, but they will not avoid deviation. Instead, there will arise a type of "hypersensitivity," further and further narrowing the boundaries of normalcy, leaving someone to be picked as closest to the boundary. (B00196321).

Enter the information from the table above on the edges worksheet.
On the vertices worksheet, copy the vertex names in the first column to the Label column.
Press the Refresh Graph button.  The result will almost certainly NOT look like an organizational chart.  We'll fix that momentarily.  
[[=image /q:0025/ch01-ex01-01.gif]]
On the vertices worksheet, select the cell range containing the vertices and adjust their appearance using the buttons on the NodeXL ribbon.
(if you have trouble seeing your vertices and/or labels try setting vertex size to 3.5 and pushing zoom all the way to the left and scale all the way to the right)
Click on the select cursor in the graph window
[[=image /q:0025/ch01-ex01-02.gif]]
Drag the vertices one by one until they look something like this:
[[=image /q:0025/ch01-ex01-03.gif]]
One layout you might have seen is shown below.  The **topology** (what is connected to what) is the same as above but this layout makes it appear that VP1 is at the middle of the organization -- the four people on either side have to go through her and this might make her some sort of "gatekeeper."  
[[=image /q:0025/ch01-ex01-04.gif]]
But we've left something out.  The vertical dimension in a "normal" organizational chart implies a relationship of "gives orders to" or "takes orders from" or "is the supervisor of" or "is the subordinate of."  Each of these is an **asymmetric relationship** and the network (graph) they produce is a **directed** one (also known as a directed graph or **digraph**).  In NodeXL we can switch the type of the graph in the graph panel of the NodeXL ribbon.  To make the lines and arrows easier to see we go to the edges worksheet and then use the edgewidth button in the visual properties panel.

No edges can be added to the network on the left.  It currently has 10 edges and so the ratio is [[$ \frac {10} {10} = 1.0 $]].  The middle network has 5 edges out of a possible 10; the ratio is [[$ \frac {5} {10} = 0.5 $]].  The network on the right has zero edges so the ratio is 0.0.

# Name at least ten areas of human, social, natural phenomena that have been explored by network researchers.
# Identify/describe three networks you have encountered this week.
# Name at least five academic disciplines in which the study of networks has become a big deal.

* Meta
# Newman, et al. mention "theoretical" work, "empirical" work, and modeling as activities associated with network science.  What do you understand by each of these?
# Hansen, et al. (and to a lesser extent other authors here) suggest some grandiose assessments of network science's place in the history of science.  Newman et al. hint at some tensions between the kind of data social scientists collect and the tools they have for analyzing them and the kind of data used in the "new science of networks" and the tools brought to the task by physicists and computer scientists.  Can you zero in on the passages and identify some of the issues?
# In sections 1.6-8, Hansen et al. describe applications of social media to public problems, crowdsourcing, and problems of engagement, mentioning, eventually, the term "sociotechnical systems." Meditate a bit on the dual answers this suggests to the question "how can I use my degree in sociology (or whatever your major is)?" -- either studying how technology changes the world or being actively involved in designing things that can change the world.

* Real World
# From how many realms do your facebook friends come?  Estimate the macro-structure of your facebook network just based on thinking about it.  How does it show the different social circles you are a member of?  How does it show your different "sides"?  How does it show your personal biography?  How big do you think the different clusters are?  Can you think of people who link the different clusters together?

Copy screen image to clipboard with alt-F14 or alt-PrtScn, open a Word document and paste.  Crop the picture (Picture Tools>Format>Crop), unselect it, reselect it and stretch to fill page.

Examine clusters.  Now select the picture and Cut it (control-X) and then Insert>Shapes>New Drawing Canvas, expand the canvas to be page-sized, and paste the picture.  Then use the circle tool to draw circles around the identifiable clusters.
[[=image /soc180:images/q0046-001.gif size="medium"]]
Now let's create a new drawing canvas and sketch this network of clusters.
[[=image /soc180:images/q0046-005.gif size="medium"]]
And then we will examine the books qualitatively -- back on the web interface -- to come up with coarse descriptions of the clusters.
[[=image /soc180:images/q0046-009.gif size="medium"]]
Finally, we inquire as to what connections the inter-cluster edges represent, like this:
[[=image /soc180:images/q0046-010.gif size="medium"]]
And ueber-finally, let's prepare this network for data entry in NodeXL

Here's the work flow if we want to carry this out "smart":

# Enter affiliation network data in rectangular matrix format in Excel (here it will be a 9 rows by 4 columns matrix -- plus labels). Let's call this matrix **A**.
# Create the square matrices -- persons by persons and flavors by flavors -- by multiplying the matrix and its inverse
 * In matrix multiplication of A*B the number columns of A has to match the number of rows of B
 * The result is a matrix with the number of rows of A and the number of columns of B
 * Our rectangular matrix has 9 rows and 4 columns.  We want to produce a 9x9 persons matrix and a 4x4 flavors matrix.
 * The matrix transpose(A) is just A with columns and rows interchanged.  It has 4 columns and 9 rows.
 * 9x9 persons matrix **P** = 9x4 matrix **A** TIMES 4x9 matrix **transpose(A)**
 * 4x4 flavors matrix **F** = 4x9 matrix **transpose(A)** TIMES 9x4 matrix **A**
# We place these each in its own worksheet starting in cell A1
 * [[image /soc180:images/q0049a.gif]]
 * [[image /soc180:images/q0049b.gif]]
# We might want to eliminate the entries on the main diagonal to prevent self-edges
# In NodeXL we go to the Import menu and select "From Open Matrix Notebook"
 * [[image /soc180:images/q0049c.gif]]
# With these specifications since we DO have vertex names in the first row and first column
 * [[image /soc180:images/q0049d.gif]]

And then we can tweak the images -- copying vertex names for labels, using Autofill Columns to set edge width to the edge weight column, and playing with colors as we like.

Assume we have powerful access to the Twitter stream (meaning we can grab all the tweets in a given time frame, all the tweets by a set of users, all the tweets that mention a hashtag or a user, etc.  And assume we have access to the API and so can take a user name and get a list of who she follows or who follows her.

Describe five different networks we might construct from this data.

[[iftags _showsolutions]]

[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
# Who retweets whom.  Network of users with directed edges meaning A retweets B.  In one direction it's a sort of recommendation.  In the other direction a sort game of telephone (I repeat to my audience what you said to yours)
# Hashtags that are co-mentioned in tweets.  Vertices are hashtags and they are more or less connected depending on how often they appear together.  Network represents relatedness of ideas/issues/topics?
# Users who are mentioned (@ symbol) in tweets.  Could be taken as suggesting both are known by the tweeter?
# Who mentions/responds to whom.  Vertices are users, one is the tweeter and the other is the mention.  Each tweet could generate multiple directed edges (or none if tweet mentions no one).
# Either users and hashtags or mentions and hashtags.  Edges would suggest thought communities -- who is talking about (or in connection with) what.

The program tells me I have 32 total connected components, of which 26 are single vertices.  Thus, 26/343 or about 7.5% of my Facebook friends are singletons -- not friends with any of my other friends.  And then the rest of my friends are divided among 6 connected components.

The "giant component" contains 300 of my 343 friends.  The other five connected components are five friends from my graduate dorm, two students from the class of ~2004 (one who is Czech and one who studied there), two folks I who worked in New Haven city government when I lived there, a married couple who also lived in the graduate dorm, and my two college physics teachers.   These last three do not show up on the visualization because I set the visibility threshold to degree 2 and above and the members of these dyads each have degree 1.

My 343 friends could have a maximum of [[$ \frac {343 \times (343-1)} {2} = 58,653 $]] edges.  In fact they have 1,578.  Therefore, the density of the network is [[$ \frac {1,578} {58,653} = 0.0269 $]].

The maximum "degrees of separation" among my connected friends is 10 and the average distance between any two friends (not including me - that would always be 2) is 3.6.

# Does the traffic flow deliberately or blindly/randomly?

> (From [http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/data/esna/scotland.htm Pajek data online]) This dataset contains the corporate interlocks in Scotland in the beginning of the twentieth century (1904-5). In the nineteenth century, the industrial revolution brought Scotland railways and industrialization, especially heavy industry and textile industry. The amount of capital needed for these large scale undertakings exceeded the means of private families, so joint stock companies were established, which could raise the required capital. Joint stock companies are owned by the shareholders, who are represented by a board of directors. This opens up the possibility of interlocking directorates. By the end of the nineteenth century, joint stock companies had become the predominant form of business enterprise at the expense of private family businesses. Families, however, still exercised control through ownership and directorships.
>
> The data are taken from the book The Anatomy of Scottish Capital by John Scott and Michael Hughes. It lists the (136) multiple directors of the 108 largest joint stock companies in Scotland in 1904-5: 64 non-financial firms, 8 banks, 14 insurance companies, and 22 investment and property companies (Scotland.net). In this dataset, which was compiled from the Appendix of Scott & Hughes' book, note that two multiple directors (W.S. Fraser and C.D. Menzies) are affiliated with just one board so they are not multiple directors in the strict sense.
> The companies are classified according to industry type: 1 - oil & mining, 2 - railway, 3 - engineering & steel, 4 - electricity & chemicals, 5 - domestic products, 6 - banks, 7 - insurance, and 8 - investment. In addition, there is a vector specifying the total capital or deposits of the firms in 1,000 pound sterling.

Use NodeXL to visualize this data.  The data is in three network datasets: a bipartite network of people and companies (edges represent a person being a director of a company); a network of people (the edges are co-membership in companies); and a network of companies (edges are sharing a director).

Task 1: Create a preliminary two mode visualization that shows people as small circles and companies as larger squares.  Try different layouts (including manually assisted) and produce the best visualization you can (in a reasonable amount of time).  Can you color the companies by industry?  Are there individuals who appear to be bridges between industries?  Or who appear to be kingpins in a particular industry?

Task 2: Do a quick exploration of the people by people network.  Try different visualizations.  Calculate graph metrics.  It might clarify the visualization if you use dynamic filtering to discard barely connected individuals.  Change node size by graph metric.  Can you identify a class of apparently important people?  Try clustering.

Task 3: Now look at company by company network.  Cluster, color, explore.  How much do network clusters follow industry?  Are there cluster bridging companies?  Are you surprised at what they are.

Turn in short paper that shows your explorations.

The data is in the following Excel files.

This medical advice protocol has two top level parts: one for women and one for men.

For women, it says those over 40 should have the test.  And it says no matter what your age, if either parent had diabetes you should have the test.  

For men, it says only take the test if you are overweight.

We might be tempted to distraction by phrases like "no matter what" and "only" but a little bit of parsing and rephrasing helps to clarify.

Start by looking at the syntax of the logic to make sure we understand it.

Step 1: do A
Step 2: do B
Step 3: If C, then while E do F and after that do G, otherwise do H
Step 4: do I

Do a first draft that treats step three as a black box.

Next, starting from the outside and working in, we draw the flow chart for "if C do something (the while stuff) otherwise do something else (H)":
[[=image ppol225:images/chart-4-solution-b.gif size="small"]]
And now, let's leave the "while loop" as a black box and fill in a few more details.  It's now "if C do the while thing and then do G.

 If A do X otherwise Y

# District Attorney and Defense Attorney present to Judge in assigned Criminal Court a completed Rock County Drug Court Contract and a copy of the defendant’s criminal history (either NCIC Report or CCAP Record of Convictions).
# Criminal Court Judge determines the defendant may be eligible for Drug Court so the matter is continued for two (2) weeks before the same court. Judge orders defendant to attend an initial screening at the offices of the Rock County Community RECAP Program, 303 W. Court Street, Janesville, WI on the following Tuesday.
# Court Attendant for the Criminal Court will then immediately photocopy the completed Drug Court Contract, the defendant’s criminal record (either NCIC or CCAP), and the criminal complaint in the present matter and place them in an envelope and put it in the mailbox of the Community RECAP Program that is located in the Courthouse mailroom.
# The Court Attendant will daily FAX a list of the defendants referred the Community RECAP Program, providing the defendant’s name, date of birth, and case number. This will be FAXed daily to (608)743-1759 to provide that office with a list of the defendants they should expect the following Tuesday for the initial screening.
# Upon completion of the initial screening the Community RECAP office will FAX to the Criminal Court a document indicating the completion of the initial screening and whether the defendant is qualified for the Drug Court. If the defendant is eligible, the Community RECAP office will provide the defendant with an appointment date (scheduled after his next scheduled return to the Criminal court) for completion of the intake process and to complete a full assessment of the defendants needs. The defendant will also be scheduled with an initial date for first appearance at Drug Court. This information will also be contained in the FAX sent to the Criminal court.
# After the initial screening, the defendant returns to the Criminal Court. If the Community RECAP FAX (from #5 above) has been received by the court and it indicates that the defendant is eligible for the Drug Court, then the Criminal Court will take the plea to the original charge but will withhold a finding of guilt. The Court will then order the clerk to place the file in status “Deferred Pending”, continue bond and order the defendant to the Drug Court appearance indicated on that FAX.
# The Court Attendant will then photocopy the following documents, place them in an envelope, and forward them to Judge John Roethe of the Drug Court as these documents will constitute the Drug Court file:
 # Criminal complaint,
 # Completed Drug Court Contract,
 # NCIC or CCAP criminal history of the defendant,
 # Community RECAP Program FAX indicating the completion of the initial screening and initial date for first appearance before the Drug Court.
# The matter will not return to the Criminal Court until the defendant either successfully completes the program or is removed from the program. If the defendant successfully completed the program the court will implement the agreement outlined in the Drug Court Contract. If for any reason the defendant fails to complete the program the defendant’s original plea will be perfected the entry of a finding of guilt and the matter will proceed to sentencing on the original charge.

If there, pull up record and verify information. If not, create new record and ask for information. When done, send record to orientation staff, give youth a number and instruct to wait until number is called.  (b) Once stage three in the treatment regimen is completed, clients are not eligible for the next stage in treatment until they have had three consecutive clean weekly drug tests. If they have one failed test they are given a warning. Two failed tests in a row and they have to meet with a counselor.  Three failed tests and they are out of the program.

[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
(b) This "system" sorts clients into three categories – either you are between steps 3 and 4 (working on drug tests), you are ready to do step 4, or you are out of the program. We need a black box that will sort clients into one of two categories: on to step four or out of program.

[[=image ppol225:images/prob11b-002.gif]]

The main test for being out of the program is failing three tests.  Otherwise you are still in until you pass three in a row.  So, in English it might be "while you haven't failed thrice, keep testing until you get three in a row clean."

What does "All the Rest" have to accomplish?  Drug tests.  Count successes and failures.  Warn on one failure, counseling on two.  Reset success to zero after a failure.  To think clearly about this, I want to remember that all I need to do is design logic that has a single entry point and a single exit point and that at the exit point we'll be ready to apply these tests about whether we are in the 3 passes in a row state, the 3 failures state, or the try again state.

Let's write out the logic in English:

# Take a drug test.
# If you pass, add one to the number of passed tests.
# If you fail, set number of passed tests to zero (start over) and add one to the number of failed tests.
 #  If you have one failed test, get a warning
 #  If you have two failed tests, get counseling

I have an urge to follow this up with the next two tests, but remember I've got my "repeat while until" logic outside this black box.  Let's see what this might look like.

Any given problem, they suggest, can be placed in one of four categories: (1) market AND government failure; (2) government works (policy corrects for market failure); (3) market works; (4) government failure to correct for market failure. Their suggested strategy is to start by asking whether there is a market failure and then whether there is government failure.  Using the two conditionals, "Is there evidence of market failure?" and "Is there evidence of government failure?" construct a flowchart that would permit you to classify any given situation into one of the four aforementioned categories.

This is an example of a classic use of flow chart logic to describe a sorting process.  Basically we are using two tests to create a 2x2 taxonomy (classification system).  It might look like this

||~ Diagnosis||~ Test 1||~ Test 2||
||Promising||= Pass||= Pass||
||Troubling||= Pass||= Fail||
||Recalcitrant||= Fail||= Pass||
||Hopeless||= Fail||= Fail||

Our logic is then

If pass test 1, then if pass test test then "promising" otherwise "troubling."  On the other hand, if fail test 1 then if pass test 2 then "recalcitrant" otherwise "hopeless."

The Alameda County Waste Management Authority (ACWMA) has decided to spend some money on a public relations campaign to increase the level of composting ("green bin") recylcing.   Data on hand says that current levels are 4 kg per household of four per week.  The plan is to spend $10,000 on advertising each month until the level has gone over 6 kg per week for four weeks in a row.
Prefatory concern – what does 4 kg / household of 4 / week mean?  The amount of compost likely depends on the number of people in a household.  We don't want to get the numbers wrong by failing to take this into account.  So, in our data collection, we double the number for households of 2, halve it for households of 8, etc.  Why not just express it as "kg/person/week"?  That would work fine mathematically.  Perhaps the PR folks had wanted to focus on households (and families) so as to induce a greater sense of collective responsibility.

New solution based on excellent in-class comments 27 September 2012.  Strong point made that unless the car was more useful to the buyer than the $4000 then it would an almost trivial problem: the existence of any risk at all that the car is a lemon would make me not buy it.

I think we can take this into account and still present a simple and elegant solution.  Let us simply recognize that the motivation to do the exchange (that is, buy the car), suggests that the value TO THE BUYER is at least $4000 and almost certainly at least $4000 plus a little bit more.  This based on the idea that the market exchange happens when the exchange is somehow mutually beneficial.

# If I am willing to buy this car in good working condition for $4000 then we can assume the value to me of having this car in good working condition is **at least** $4000.  One way to write this is [[$ V = 4000 + x\quad where\quad x\ge 0 $]].[[/span]][[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
# As usual, we use the accounting principle of figuring out what all of our assets and liabilities are at a specific moment in time.
# This will yield the following possible outcomes situations (we ignore the "impossible" situations such as the car is a known lemon but I buy it anyway)

||Mechanic||Car Passed Test||Bought Car||Car Needed Repair||Cost of Mechanic||Cost of Repair||Value of Car||Cash||
||= YES||= YES||= YES||= NO||= -T||= 0||= 4000+x||0||
||= YES||= NO||= NO||= NO||= -T||= 0||= 0||= 4000||

There are, as you probably have discovered, different ways of thinking about this problem.  Let's try to find the simplest one.

The main thing we want to determine is how much it would make sense to pay a mechanic to eliminate the uncertainty about buying a lemon.

The bank says it has to know what your house is worth (It has to be worth a certain amount over what we still owe on the mortgage to get a loan at a good rate).  A loan at a bad rate will cost $10,000 more than a loan at a good rate.  We think there is a 60:40 chance that our house is in fact worth enough to get a good rate.  We have a choice between a cheap appraisal ($100) and an expensive appraisal ($1000).  A cheap appraisal, we have learned, has a 40% chance of correctly valuing a property.  An expensive appraisal is right 70% of the time. Draw a decision tree that will help us figure out what to do.

[[iftags _showsolutions]]
[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
Let's start by putting the facts down.

# Two kinds of loan may be offered, "good" and "bad."  Price on "bad" is $10k higher than "good."
# Actual house value may be "high" or "low."
# An appraisal will estimate the value of the house (this is a test).
# Good loan is offered if house is appraised "high."
# There is 60% chance that house value is actually high.
# Cheap appraisal gets it right 40% of the time.  Cost is 100.
# Expensive appraisal gets it right 70% of the time.

Note: in the real world, it gets even more interesting.  Sometimes, if the house appraises high, the bank pays for the appraisal.

Let's look at the DT

+++ What is the main decision?  Which appraisal to use.

[[=image ppol225:images/DT-prob-10a.gif]]
This might feel counter-intuitive.  Let's look more closely and ask what is tilting us in the direction of the cheaper appraisal.  

First of all, we said that there is only a 60 percent chance that the house really IS worth the high value.  This is just a little more likely than 50/50.  And the expensive appraisal can be wrong even if the house IS worth a lot.  And then we have to look at the other end.  The cheap appraisal could work in our favor: during the 40% of the time where the house is not of high value this appraisal will get it wrong, call the value high and get us the cheap loan, about 60% of the time.  

Note that along the way we ended up looking at several "AND" probabilities

P(\mbox{IS high AND appraises high}) = P(\mbox{high}) \times P(\mbox{appraises high} | \mbox{high})

But if she plants early and there's a late frost she can lose 50% of her harvest.  Historically, these late frosts happen one year in four (25% of the time).  Use a decision tree to determine how much she would be willing to invest in a perfect forecast.



[[iftags _showsolutions]]
[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
Step 1 is to layout the choices and chances.
* Choose to plant early or not.
* The weather then happens.
[[=image ppol225:images/DT-prob-12a.jpg]]
Next we can fill in the rest of the information, but let's remember that we are ultimately interested in how much the forecast information will be worth.

Let's say the value of the regular harvest is 1.  That means the extra bountiful harvest will be 1.20 (120% of normal) and the disaster harvest will be 0.5 (50% of normal).
[[=image ppol225:images/DT-prob-12b.jpg]]

And then we put in the test (forecast) branches on the left and do the math.  We call the cost of the forecast T as we have for other tests.  We assume that it's a perfect forecast; if the forecast says warm, it will be warm.  For completeness we show a decision node after the forecast but since the probabilities to the right are 1 and 0 or 0 and 1, the decision is clear:  if the weather will be warm, we plant early; if cold, late.

The final (or rather first) choice node is now a comparison of 1.15-T and 1.025.  Thus, for any T < 0.125 we would prefer to get the forecast.  Knowing what the weather will be is worth about 1/8 of the value of the annual harvest.

[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]

The Excel worksheet version of this solution [[file Problem0121.xlsx|is available here]].

Here is the full stock and flow diagram.  Note that we have included three variables/parameters: the amounts for inflow and consumption and the rate for leakage and we have connected these with arrows to the valves on the corresponding flows.  Note too that we have an arrow going from the reservoir to the valve on the leakage flow.  This is because this flow depends on the rate parameter AND the volume in the reservoir at any given time.

[[=image ppol225:images-stockflow/P121-SnFdiagram.png]]

**The causal loop** diagram is pretty simple.  One approach is to see that we can combine the inflow and the consumption and leakage into a single "net in/out flow":

[[=image ppol225:images-stockflow/P121-CausalLoop.png]]

A more complete/explicit treatment can include these as separate variables but note that the only causal loop is the one with the leakage:

[[=image ppol225:images-stockflow/P121-CausalLoop2.png]]

Amounts are INFLOW (200 million gallons per month) and OUTFLOW (-150 million gallons per month)
Rate is 5% of current volume LEAKAGE per month.  Put another way, 95% (i.e., 100% - 5%) does not leak each month.

The net amount, **b**, is 200-150=50 (we will assume our units are millions of gallons).  The rate, **a**, is 0.95.  Thus we have

[[/span]]

[[math]]
Volume_{n+1} = Volume_n - LEAKAGE_n + INFLOW - CONSUMPTION
[[/math]]

[[math]]
LEAKAGE_n = 0.05 \times VOLUME_n
[[/math]]

[[math]]
Volume_{n+1} = (Volume_n - 0.05 \times VOLUME_n) + (INFLOW - CONSUMPTION)
[[/math]]

[[math]]
Volume_{n+1} = (1 - 0.05)  \times Volume_n + (INFLOW - CONSUMPTION)
[[/math]]

[[math]]
Volume_{n+1} = 0.95 \times Volume_n + 50
[[/math]]

[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
The Excel solution would look like this:

Here's the chart set up:

[[=image ppol225:images-stockflow/p121-chart-data.png size="small"]]

If we extend the model out to 100 or so time periods we can see the asymptotic equilibrium that is reached as leakage just exactly balances inflow minus consumption.

The thermostat can measure the current temperature and it knows the set temperature.  And how is time involved?  The measured temperature of the house probably does not change immediately as soon as more warm air is added.

This is a typical "quote and explicate" passage.  The overall structure is fine, though will want to tweak it a bit.  The main problem is that the paraphrase doesn't really convey what the quote says.

Here is our first fix:

We do not need to use (Goffman 1961:22) because the author is named in the sentence.

Now on to the paraphrase.  What the author wrote sounds a lot like the looking glass self; the author says actors envision how they'll be seen by others and implies that they can target their performance accordingly.  But what Goffman said was different: performances have many parts, one of which he wants to call "front."  This will designate those parts of the performance which send generic signals about what's going on (that is, define the situation).   The distinction that Goffman wants to make is between the framing stuff you bring to the performance to set the scene and the stuff you do as you carry out the performance.  We might try this

||~ Text||~ Explication||
||In "The Production of Consciousness," Marx (1845-1846) writes,“Men can be distinguished from the animals by consciousness, by religion, or by whatever one wants. They begin to distinguish themselves from the animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of life, a step which is determined by their physical organisation. In producing their means of life they indirectly produce their material life itself” (46).||In other words, Marx is saying that the difference between a human being and an animal is that human beings have consciousness and work and contribute to production that allow them to produce their means of life; therefore, work is essential to humans’ interactions.||

[[iftags _showsolutions]]
[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]

What is the point here?  It's not just to distinguish animals and humans; Marx is also laying down a foundation for his "anthropology" beginning with the point that material precedes ideal.

Let's look carefully at the Marx quote:

||~ Marx||~ Notes and Attempt at Explication||
||[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]//Men can be distinguished from the animals by consciousness, by religion, or by whatever one wants.//[[/span]]||[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]Perhaps Marx is saying that there are lots of ways that humans are different from animals but that just identifying these misses the point?  Note too that the things he mentions here are in the realm of ideas.  _
 _
Recalling that Marx "turned Hegel on his head" and substituted the material for the ideal, we note that this first phrase is the first half of a point being made.[[/span]]||
|||| ||
||[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]//They begin to distinguish themselves from the animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of life,//[[/span]]||[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]It is making things that sustain us that sets us apart.  We might ponder where Marx would draw the line: a lion is surely working when she chases down prey, no?  If we assume Marx was thinking a little like an historical anthropologist, perhaps we can assume that he means work that is oriented toward creating a means of life that goes beyond the next meal?[[/span]]||
|||| ||
||[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]//a step which is determined by their physical organisation.//[[/span]]||[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]Does Marx mean that human physiology makes us become producers of our means of life?  Or does he mean the physical organization of humans (what we might call the social organization - into families, tribes, teams, etc.)?  If he means the latter, doesn't this already presume the very social order we are trying to explain?  This may not be a problem here because in these sentences Marx is not actually addressing that question.[[/span]]||
|||| ||
||[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]//In producing their means of life they indirectly produce their material life itself.//[[/span]]||[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]What is our "material life"?  I think you can take this as saying that the material conditions of our existence - the conditions of being human in a particular time and place, are (at least "indirectly") created by the way we produce our sustenance.[[/span]]||
[[/span]]

[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]So, the points we have are these

# We often distinguish humans from animals on the basis of psychological stuff
# But the real difference is that humans have to produce their "means of life"
# This activity produces the material conditions of human existence (implied: out of which other stuff comes)

And so we try again:

||[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]//In "The Production of Consciousness," Marx (1818-1873) writes,“Men can be distinguished from the animals by consciousness, by religion, or by whatever one wants. They begin to distinguish themselves from the animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of life, a step which is determined by their physical organisation. In producing their means of life they indirectly produce their material life itself” (46).//[[/span]]||[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]In other words, Marx says that consciousness and social institutions might distinguish human beings and animals, but they are not where the difference starts.  The origin lies in the fact that humans have to produce their means of life.  This creates the "material conditions of human existence" out of which emerges their consciousness.[[/span]]||

What states can homes be in?  They can be in the first year of a ten year mortgage, the second, the third, and so on.  After ten years they would be in the state "owned free and clear."  Each state has a 90% chance of transition to the following year and a 10% of transitioning back to a first year mortgage if the house is sold and bought.  Even houses that are owned free and clear have a 10% chance of being resold in this model.

In the market in question there is approximately 5% turnover housing each year. The housing stock in the market consists of one million units. Research has shown that 33 1/3% of subprime adjustable mortgages go into default under current conditions when they go past their five year mark (and these conditions are expected to continue for some time) when they adjust.

[[iftags _showsolutions]]
[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
Let's start by organizing what we know.
What states can a housing unit be in?  There are regular mortgages and subprime mortgages.  Some subprimes are in their lower payment first five years, some are in the post five year larger payment zone. Mortgages can be in good standing or in default.

A Regular Good Standing
B Regular Default (problem suggests there are none of these)
C Subprime Pre-Adjustment
D Subprime Post-Adjustment Good standing
E Subprime Post-Adjustment Default
F For Sale

What transitions do we know about?  These are not final numbers, just a first attempt to translate the above.
A > A 100%
A > B 0%
C > DorE 20%
C > D 20% x 67.7% = 13.33%
C > E 20% x 33.3% = 6.67%
C > C 50%

Any state > F 5%

Since nothing ever goes into state B we can just eliminate it.

A regular mortgage in good standing is likely to stay that way (95%) or be sold (5%) in this model.  

|| ||~ A||~ C||~ D||~ E||~ F||
||~ A||0.95||0||0||0||0.05||

A subprime mortgage, other things equal, also has a 5% chance of going back on the market.  Of those that do not go on the market, assuming they were made at a steady rate, has a 1 in 5 chance of hitting its adjustable year and a 1 in 3 chance of defaulting when it does.

0.95 x 0.2 x 0.33 = 0.0627 default
0.95 x 0.2 x 0.67 = 0.1254 not default
0.05 for sale
0.95 x 0.8 = 0.76 pre-adjustment
|| ||~ A||~ C||~ D||~ E||~ F||
||~ C||0.0||0.76||0.1254||0.0627||0.05||

Each year, a subprime mortgage that is past its adjustment year has a 1 in 3 chance of going into default.  Thus

|| ||~ A||~ C||~ D||~ E||~ F||
||~ D||= 0||= 0||= 0.67||= 0.33||= 0||


In the current model, E is an absorbing state: we are not modeling how housed come out of default.
|| ||~ A||~ C||~ D||~ E||~ F||
||~ E||= 0||= 0||= 0||= 1||= 0||

Finally, based on the information we have, we should assume that all houses that are for sale will be sold and that there is a 1 in 4 chance they'll be sold with a subprime mortgage (our model implies that no one has woken up to the scale of the problem)

|| ||~ A||~ C||~ D||~ E||~ F||
||~ F||= 0.75||= 0.25||= 0||= 0||= 0||

And finally we can put it all together like this:

|| ||~ A||~ C||~ D||~ E||~ F||
||~ A||= 0.95||= 0||= 0||= 0||= 0.05||
||~ B||= 0||= 0||= 0||= 0||= 0||
||~ C||0.0||0.76||0.1254||0.0627||0.05||
||~ D||= 0||= 0||= 0.67||= 0.33||= 0||
||~ E||= 0||= 0||= 0||= 1||= 0||
||~ F||= 0.75||= 0.25||= 0||= 0||= 0||

Inmates may leave the facility in either of two ways. In any period, there is a 10 percent probability that an inmate will be judged rehabilitated, in which case s/he will be released at the beginning of the following period.. There is also a 5 percent chance that an inmate will escape during each period. Rehabilitated addicts have a 20 percent chance of relapsing in each period; escapees have a 10 percent chance of being recaptured each period. Both recidivists and recaptured escapees are returned to the facility and have priority over new offenders.

Questions

If it operates at full capacity, how many of the original inmates will be resident at the facility 10 periods later?
How many new offenders can be admitted during each of the next 2 periods?
What happens if we modify the model to allow for a small possibility of death or a change in the probability of relapse?

First we draw the state diagram.
[[=image ppol225:images/p0156-markov-state-diagram.jpg]]

Next we translate this into a transition matrix, T.
[[=image ppol225:images/p0156-transition-matrix.jpg]]


Let's make sure we remember what the rows, columns, and elements of this matrix represent.
[[=image ppol225:images/p0156-transition-matrix-represents.jpg]]    
To calculate the populations of each of the states at the next time period, we multiply current populations by all the relevant transition rates. This gets a little messy, but we can handle it if we proceed systematically.
[[=image ppol225:images/p0156-equations.jpg]]

These equations represent an operation we call "matrix multiplication." What we are doing here is multiplying the four-tuple that represents the current populations of the four states times four sets of transition rates, one for each destination state. This amounts to multiplying each column of the transition matrix times the four-tuple of current population numbers.

||~ Text||~ Explication||
||In ‘Genesis and the Development of a Scientific Fact’, Fleck refers to language as a key form of interaction. He writes, “Thoughts pass from one individual to another, each time a little transformed, for each individual can attach to them somewhat different associations” (55).||That is, thoughts that are submitted through language can inspire new and different meanings once shared through spoken word.||

[[iftags _showsolutions]]
[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]

I don't think the focus for Fleck is necessarily the //spoken// word so much as language as a medium through which ideas are passed around, shared, "participated in" together.  Think about how we might describe the mechanism by which a group reaches consensus.  We each take a shot at explaining how we see something and each of us listens to the other, each adjusts her mental picture slightly to take into account the insights that reside in the differences between how we see things.

Or think about how we pass along a theoretical insight.  Each of us is thinking about some problem.  Someone puts forth a theory or an explanation.  Another person hears it, understands it, and then explains it to the next person.  But when she does so, she does it in a manner that reflects how she understood the new theory in terms of things she's seen, things she "knows."  This gets repeated.  Sometimes multiple thinkers collaborate and produce a version that makes sense to all them.  Sometimes someone who already grasped the idea hears it repeated back and gets a little new insight from the subtle changes the idea has undergone.  Sometimes a whole bunch of thinkers hear or read about a version of the idea from the same source at the same time.  They use the idea to design research or build products or to interpret other events.  Over time, the idea takes on a life of its own, something that people can both know and know about.

||##blue|Thus, Fleck argues, language creates thought collectives.##||[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]Not, actually, in this passage.  Thus, we might not want to say "thus" here.[[/span]]||

This passage is from Ludwik Fleck's Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact.  Let's break it up into the points it is making:

# Independent of truth and correct understanding, ideas float around.
# Findings are passed from person to person to person
# They get changed along the way.
# They get reinforced along the way.
# They change how people see the world.
# This affects how people see other ideas.

Two important elements of what Fleck is saying are that (1) once people start passing it around, a "fact" has a life of its own independent of whether it is right or wrong, unconnected, as it were, from the reality it represents; and (2) the people who pass it around can change it and the act of receiving an idea and passing it on changes people's take on the world.

> ...it is with the people of his clan that he has most in common, and it is the influence of this group that he feels most immediately, and so it is also this influence, more than any other, that was bound to find expression in religious symbols” (55).

Can you make any connections to Mead's generalized other? Or the generic idea of having some of our mental content being social?
[[iftags _showsolutions]]
[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
What is Durkheim explaining here?  

The question on the table is why do we make the leap that what the totemic symbol symbolizes is the group (clan) itself.  On the one hand, there's the superficial point that the turtle people use a stylized turtle as their totem and so, //de facto//, the turtle stands for the turtle clan.  But we want a mechanism of sorts.

Durkheim offers two observations:
# others in the clan are people with whom an individual has most in common
# group influence is the force with which a person experiences most immediately

What do we mean by this latter observation?  Durkheim seems to be suggesting that people who live in groups experience the mysterious "pressure" of similarity as the most palpable force in their lives.  

This short passage does not do all the work of associating group/clan and totem.  Its focus is on possible origin of the idea of the power of the clan totem to "want" members to behave in certain ways.

CAN you make any connections to Mead's generalized other? Or the generic idea of having some of our mental content being social?

An equation based model or aggregate model or wholistic model is one in which the quantities of interest are about the behavior of the system as a whole rather than the behavior of the parts.  In a stock and flow model, for example, we talk about the total amount of water in the reservoir or students still enrolled in school, rather than looking at the behavior of individual water molecules or students.  In an agent model, we "model" the individual units, allow them to interact, and then measure the system level outcomes.

EXTRA: Since this set of eight digits are all zeroes and ones we can interpret is as a binary number between 0 (that is, 00000000) and 255 (that is, 11111111).  And so we can think of the rules as Rule 1, Rule 2, etc.  Here's what rule 93 looks like: 01011101

[[size larger]]**[[[q:0170|Q170]]].**[[/size]] Suppose you have a population of one hundred persons.  It is divided into five categories of willingness to join a protest all of which depend on people's expectations of how many others will appear at the protest.  The thresholds range from very low (I'll go if anyone else is going) to the very high (I won't go unless basically everybody else is going).

Assume the population is divided among these categories as follows:

||~ Challenge of Recruiting||~ Very Easy||~ Easy||~ Average||~ Hard||~ Very Hard||
||Participation Threshold||= 1||= 10||= 40||= 60||= 99||
||Number at this threshold||= 10||= 20||= 40||= 20||= 10||

a. If news reports suggest that 15 people will show up, how many actually will?  

b. If last week saw participation of 41 and this is widely reported so that everyone knows, how many will come out this week? And then next week? And after that?

c. What if 91 came last week?
[[iftags _showsolutions]]
[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
a. The expected 15 are enough for both the "very easy" and the "easy" group and so we can expect a total of 10+20=30 to show up.

b. The 41 from last week will inspire the average folks to turn out AND the easy and the very easy so next week we will see 10+20+40=70.  This number will also inspire the hard so we will get 70+20 the following week.  But the total of 90 will not inspire anyone in the very hard category so the number will stay at 90.

c. Last week's 91 won't be enough to inspire the very hard so we will see a drop to 90.

[[iftags _showsolutions]]
[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
Here's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect Wikipedia's] description:
> The bandwagon effect is a well documented form of groupthink in behavioral science and has many applications. The general rule is that conduct or beliefs spread among people, as fads and trends clearly do, with "the probability of any individual adopting it increasing with the proportion who have already done so".[1] As more people come to believe in something, others also "hop on the bandwagon" regardless of the underlying evidence. The tendency to follow the actions or beliefs of others can occur because individuals directly prefer to conform, or because individuals derive information from others.

The metaphor suggests that a bandwagon goes through town and people's inclination to jump on is dependent on how many people have already jumped on board.  The implication is that the sole motivating factor is the fact that others have already joined.  The more who join, the more the motivation despite the fact that nothing changed about the bandwagon and nothing changes in individuals' preferences for riding on a bandwagon.

Draw the event tree that describes the possible election outcomes.

Our campaign director has the opportunity to do one last ad buy of $1 million.  Research and experience have shown that an ad buy in a right state where a significant portion of the electorate is still open minded could shift the odds of winning to 60/40. How do we know?  We've done lots of audience research that shows how particular electorates respond to this ad's approach.  But doing the ad buy in the wrong state (one where folks have really made up their minds) will have no effect on the outcome.  What we don't know is which, if either, of these states is the best fit for this type of campaigning.

Draw this decision tree.

Now suppose there is a poll she could do to find out whether state A or state B is the more promising state for the new ad.  There is a 50% chance the poll says state A and a 50% chance it says state B.  If it says state A then you do the ad buy there and you are certain to increase your chances while things in B stay the same.  And vice versa.

What is the value of the information the poll can provide, in electoral votes?

Over the course of the campaign it tends to recruit 4 new people every week but it also loses about 10% of its membership due to fatigue each week. The committee began in June with 6 members.  Write the difference equations that describe the size of the committee (S) each week.  What's the long term prognosis?

What are the rates and what are the amounts?  

Rate: -0.1members/week
Amount: +4 members/week

S,,n+1,, = S,,n,, - 0.1 S,,n,, + 4
S,,n+1,, = 0.9 S,,n,, +4

How will the membership evolve if it starts with 6?  It will grow toward an equilibrium:

S,,e,, = S,,n+1,, = S,,n,,
S,,e,, = 0.9 S,,e,, + 4
0.1 S,,e,, = 4
S,,n,, = 40

We can also arrive at this equilibrium figure by the generic difference equation

S,,n+1,, = a S,,n,, + b
And
S,,e,, = b / (1-a)

[[size larger]]**[[[q:0188|Q188]]].**[[/size]] "Women's issues" have been talked about a lot in the 2012 presidential campaigns.  One issue has been the hiring of women in leadership positions in society.  Draw a causal loop diagram to represent the following relationships.

The more "gender bias" the fewer qualified women there will be.
More qualified women means more women in positions of power.
The more women in power, the less "gender bias" in society.

Assuming we start with social bias and not many women in positions of power, how is this system likely to behave?

Now let's modify things a bit.  Let's suppose we solve the "supply" problem and break the link between bias and the number of qualified women and that the latter grows significantly.  We change our model slightly:

Societal bias produces social blindness to existence of qualified women.
This social blindness means fewer women will be in the pool that is considered for positions of power.
The fewer women in the pool, the fewer end up in positions of power.
And, as before, the more (fewer) women in power, the less (more) "gender bias" in society.

Draw this causal model.

Now let's add another causal relation: the fewer women in positions of power, the more NGOs emerge to promote women's participation in government, etc.  The NGOs hit on a strategy called that the men in power call "binders of women" -- whereby they do the legwork needed to show the men the qualified women that their bias made them blind to.

Add the NGOs and the binders to our causal model.  Identify a balancing loop that might portend the achievement of improved gender diversity in positions of power.

# [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek Hayek] was a mid-twentieth century Austrian-born economic theorist who won the Nobel prize in 1974 (along with Gunnar Myrdal).
# Probably most famous for early work called "The Road to Serfdom" (1940). Hayek is a hero to libertarian, free-market conservatives and so is often dismissed (and ignored) by more liberal social scientists.
# His writings range across many topics, but for our purposes what's important is his theoretical treatment of emergent, decentralized order.
# //Cosmos// and //Taxis// are from the Greek and refer to social order which emerges without central direction (cosmos) and that which is built according to a plan (taxis).  
# Provide some synonyms of each.
# Important for Hayek is the idea that some problems in the world are too complex for a single mind or an organization of minds to fully comprehend and plan a solution for. This idea is the basis for a critique of central planning and government intervention.
# But Hayek is not an anarchist! For these "market" solutions to work, social agents need to follow a limited set of rules so that their interactions can be orderly make use of local information and aggregate to yield order.  This allows Hayek to make a distinction between "rules" and "commands" - the former are more bottom up and the latter top down.
# Provide some examples of things that show order in each of the types.

CHECKLIST
# //https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith Adam Smith// is known as the originator of the phrase "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand invisible hand]."
# Smith is a mid 18th century Scottish moral philosopher and political economist.
# The phrase originates in his 1859 //Theory of Moral Sentiments,// but it is most associated with his 1776 //The Wealth of Nations,// although it only appears in that book once.
# The phrase refers to the apparent guiding force that manages to produce social order even though no one or thing is actually guiding social behavior. It is an early expression of the notion of "unintended consequences," especially the idea of unintended social benefits of selfish individual behavior.  One might see in that an early version of "micro-motives, macro-behavior" that Schelling wrote about two hundred years later.
# This points to the idea that government or state "interference" in the economy is not needed since individuals looking out for their own self interest will lead to a market equilibrium that benefits everyone.
# Perhaps most well known passage is "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages." Smith means here that we find bread on the shelves, food on our table, electricity at the outlet not because anyone wants these results but because each actor is trying to get by in her or his own business.

# This question derives from the ideas presented by Robert Axelrod in articles on the evolution of cooperation and cooperation during combat in World War I.
# Axelrod is a contemporary political scientist.
# Prisoner's Dilemma is an example of a "game" studied in the field of game theory. Game theory is most often associated with economics though other fields make use of it too (including sociology, political science, computer science, robotics, and international relations).
# In a prisoner's dilemma game there are two player or "prisoners."  We imagine they have been arrested on suspicion of having done a crime together.
# The police separate the two players and attempt to get them to "rat on" one another. The police suggest that if one rats on the other the rat will get off with a lighter sentence.
# There are three different outcomes: both prisoner's remain silent, one rats while the other stays silent, or both betray their partner.
# To be a prisoner's dilemma game, the "rewards" associated with the different outcome have to stand in a certain relation to one another. Namely:
 # Ratting on a partner who stays silent (temptation) is better than both maintaining silence (mutual cooperation)
 # Both maintaining silence (mutual cooperation) is better than both caving in (mutual defection)
 # Both caving in (mutual defection) is better than being ratted on while you stay silent (sucker's payoff)
# For each individual, defection (ratting) is better than cooperation (silence) no matter what the other player does.
 # If A is silent, B is better of ratting (temptation > mutual cooperation)
 # If A talks, B is better off talking (mutual defection > sucker's payoff)
# We say that a strategy (a choice of "moves") is DOMINANT if it is the better strategy against any possible move by the opponent.

[[iftags _showsolutions]]

[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
An equilibrium is a situation in which all the "forces" in a system are balanced. An equilibrium can be stable, meaning that it returns to equilibrium after small perturbations (changes), or unstable, meaning that small changes can result in the system shifting to some other state.

Some examples from different fields are shown below. Very important point: equilibrium does mean STATIC (i.e., frozen, nothing changing). Rather, an equilibrium is a state in which things can be changing but all the changes balance one another. In a chemical reaction in which substances A and B combine to make substance C and substance C breaks down to form A and B we reach an equilibrium when the rate at which the formation reaction equals the rate of the breakdown reaction. Molecules are constantly changing the the overall mixture reaches a steady state equilibrium.

# Forces are balanced, system will stay in a given state unless disturbed
# Does not mean static - can be even shifting back and forth, but no net change
# In game theory an equilibrium is reached when players cannot improve their situation by changing their behavior on the assumption that others stick with what they are doing.
# In the prisoner's dilemma there is an equilibrium: if we are both defecting (ratting) then neither of us can do better by changing to cooperation if the other stays with defecting.  If we are both cooperating we do better AS A WHOLE, but either of us could do better AS AN INDIVIDUAL by switching.
# In Schelling's critical mass model, an equilibrium could be stable or unstable. In a stable equilibrium, a slight change in the number who come or are expected will not change the number who actually come - the system returns to the equilibrium. In an unstable equilibrium, a slight deviation - a few more or a few less - can cause the system to "tip" - the attendance gets bigger an bigger until reaching a high participation equilibrium or it gets smaller and smaller until only a handful of die-hards attend.

If interacting, look at random number in second chart.  If a 1 then this agent is leader and other agent adopts her behaviors.  Otherwise vice versa.

Further suppose that there is some pressure toward consistency such that having a "don't do" behavior next to a "do do" behavior is uncomfortable and so agents have some internal urge to change their behavior to be more consistent.

Let's say that a behavior that is the only one of its type (a 0 among three 1s, for example) has a 50 percent chance of switching to make the set fully consistent.  Each behavior that's one of an even split (e.g., a 0 in a 0011 agent) has a 10% chance of switching. We can put it this way: there is a 10% chance the first behavior changes, 10% the second, etc. and 60% chance no change happens.

Use the two random number table below to work out the next state n the grid below, determine the probability of interaction between each pair of neighbors (assume no diagonal interaction for now).  For 50% chance use "random number above 50 = change, below 50 = stay."  For the 10% chances, 0<10 is change first, 10<20 change 2, etc.

To execute coordination we proceed as follows.  Each agent will consider in turn its north, east, south, and west neighbors.  First the agent determines whether interaction will take place at all based on similarity.  Then, if they do interact, they flip a coin to decide who is the leader and who is the follower.  Then the follower copies the traits of the leader.  And then onto the next neighbor if there is one.

We can incorporate the following design decisions into our model: (1) neighbors who have already interacted in a given round do not do so again; (2) an agent can change multiple times during a given round; (3) all interactions are with the agent's current state.

> The distinction of this kind of order from one which has been made by somebody putting the elements of a set in their places or directing their movements is indispensable for any understanding of the processes of society as well as for all social policy.  There are several terms available for describing each kind of order.  The made order which we have already referred to as an exogenous order or an arrangement may again be described as a construction, an artificial order or, especially where we have to deal with a directed social order, as an organization.  The grown order, on the other hand, which we have referred to as a self-generating or endogenous order, is in English mosts conveniently described as a spontaneous order (Hayek 1976: 142.1-3).

> This means that, though the use of spontaneous ordering forces enables us to induce the formation of an order of such a degree of complexity (namely comprising elements of such numbers, diversity and variety of conditions) as we could never master intellectually, or deliberately arrange, we will have less power over the details of such an order than we would of one which we produce by arrangement.  In the case of spontaneous orders we may, by determining some of the factors which shape them, determine their abstract features, but we will have to leave the particulars to circumstances which we do not know.  Thus, by relying on the spontaneously ordering forces, we can extend the scope or range of the order which we may induce to form, precisely because its particular manifestation will depend on many more circumstances than can be known to us-and in the case of a social order, because such an order will utilize the separate knowledge of all its several members, without this knowledge ever being concentrated in a single mind, or being subject to those processes of deliberate coordination and adaptation which a mind performs (Hayek 1976: 145.5-7).

> To put this differently: in a social order the particular circumstances to which each individual will react will be those known to him.  But the individual responses to particular circumstances will result in an overall order only if the individuals obey such rules as will produce and order.  Even a very limited similarity in their behavior may be sufficient if the rules which they all obey are such as to produce an order.  Such an order will always constitute an adaptation to the multitude of circumstances which are known to all the members of that society taken together but which are not known as a whole to any one person (Hayek 1976: 147.7).

This is a passage from Friedrich Hayek's "Cosmos and Taxis."  In this excerpt Hayek contrasts two concepts of order: "made" order is deliberate, thought up, conceptualized as a plan and implemented with the order as goal; "grown" order is emergent, no one actor or group of actors has the order in mind, no one is coordinating behavior so as to produce the order, rather individuals follow limited rule sets and respond to local information they have access to and their actions add up to an overall order. Adam Smith's "invisible hand" is the imaginary designer of this emergent order.

In this passage Hayek starts by saying that social actors have access to a local environment of circumstances and this is what s/he reacts to. But these actions will only add up to "order" if the rules according to which the actor behaves are the kinds of rules that produce order.  Although Hayek denies that there is any brain big enough to be in charge of the order, he does seem to admit that our brains might be big enough to analyze rules to determine what kinds of rules might produce order and what kinds not.  One thing he seems to suggest is that it might be important for all the actors to be following more or less the same set of rules, though he seems to be suggesting that only moderate similarity may be necessary.  

The last sentence makes the big point: people are all in different circumstances; if you permit them to figure out what's good for them to do "locally" you can generate an overall system that is well adapted to an environment that has lots of variation across space and perhaps also change over time.

# [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek Hayek] was a mid-twentieth century Austrian-born economic theorist who won the Nobel prize in 1974 (along with Gunnar Myrdal).
# Probably most famous for early work called "The Road to Serfdom" (1940). Hayek is a hero to libertarian, free-market conservatives and so is often dismissed (and ignored) by more liberal social scientists.
# His writings range across many topics, but for our purposes what's important is his theoretical treatment of emergent, decentralized order.
# This passage is from the excerpt "Cosmos and Taxis," Greek words that refer to social order which emerges without central direction (cosmos) and that which is built according to a plan (taxis).
# This passage describes how information and rules affect behavior.
# Hayek notes that individuals only have access to local information (from their own circumstances) and that this is what they react to.
# But, they have to use some basic set of rules to react to the information.
# And these rules have to be the kind of rules that will lead to order (the implication being that you could have "wrong" rules that won't produce order).
# These rules are NOT centralized commands!
# If the rules give rise to order then what we have is the "social organism" adapting to all manner of locally different circumstances even though no one knows about all the circumstances.

> In any group of men of more than the smallest size, collaboration will always rest both on spontaneous order as well as on deliberate organization.  There is no doubt that for many limited tasks organization is the most powerful method of effective co-ordination because it enables us to adapt the resulting order much more fully to our wishes, while where, becuase of the complexity of the circumstances to be taken into account, we must rely on the forces making for a spontaneous order, our power over the particular contents of this order is necessarily restricted.
>
> That the two kinds of order will regularly coexist in every society of any degree of complexity does not mean, however, that we can combine them in any manner we like.  What in fact we find in all free societies is that, although groups of men will join in organizations for the achievement of some particular ends, the co-ordination of the activities of all these separate organizations, as well as of the separate individuals, is brought about by the forces making for a spontaneous order.  The family, the farm, the plant, the firm, the corporation and the various associations, and all the public institutions including government, are organizations which in turn are integrated into a more comprehensive spontaneous order (Hayek 1976: 149.5-7).

And those who know they are healthy and have a family history of longevity and are exposed to few risks have to pay the same premium as the poorer risks; life insurance being unattractive [to them] at that price, few of them buys it.

> The Cooperation Theory that is presented...is based upon an investigation of individuals who pursue their own self-interest without the aid of a central authority to force them to cooperate with each other.  The reason for assuming self-interest is that it allows an examination of the difficult case in which cooperation is not completely based upon a concern for others or upon the welfare of the group as a whole.  It must, however, be stressed that this assumption is actually much less restrictive than it appears.  ... So the assumption of self interest is really just an assumption that concern for others does not completely solve the problem of when to cooperate with them and when not to (Axelrod 1984: 177.2).

This question asks you EXPLICATE - that means go sentence by sentence and tell us what it means. Translate it into your own words. Don't just imagine you'll make this up on the spot during the exam.  And look at the original text, not just this version - the elided part might be helpful.

Your commentary will be a chance to show that you get what Axelrod is up to, why it fits in this section of the course, and what is going on "metatheoretically" - that is, you should recognize that this is a different kind of theorizing - one that's a little more logical and mathematical in spirit than some of more narrative theories we have read.

Note too: The criticism "people are not always rational" is no better than its converse "people are sometimes rational." If we build a model starting with an assumption of self interest we are effectively bracketing, not denying, a whole package of social and psychological "stuff" that comes into play in real interactions.

Rather than choose between “the human” and “the divine” Durkheim stared religion in the face, so to speak, and showed how what we think of as divine/sacred is in fact human (social).  How do the following passages convey Durkheim’s theory of the special power of social norms and his idea about society as god and the notion that the individual, with norms and values of society internalized, can be a source of social order?//

> **Durkheim, “Collective Representations” from //Elementary Forms//**

> “An individual or collective subject is said to inspire respect when the representation that expresses it in consciousness has such power that it calls forth or inhibits conduct automatically, irrespective of any utilitarian calculation of helpful or harmful results” (50.8).
>
> “The ways of acting to which society is strongly enough attached to impose them on its members are for that reason marked with a distinguishing sign that calls forth respect” (51.1).

Points to cover:
# Durkheim first describes the force an idea can have in our heads – he calls it "inspiring respect" – when even though we might not rationally be able to say why something is harmful or helpful we automatically "know" we should not or should do it.
# Then he says that behaviors that a collective group is really attached to get marked with this "calls forth respect" property.
# Then he notes that since we experience this pressure through "mental channels," it seems rather mystical, a sort of outer inner power.  We feel something inside our heads but we experience as not of our own doing.
# Finally, Durkheim notes that it is in ritual group assembly that we feel these special feelings that we don't have when we are alone.  
# Thus, he is suggesting, the "god like" influence is associated with the group.
# Order it seems happens because "society" wants pro-social behavior (these are what it inspires "respect" for) and by putting these ideas into individuals' heads, society can run on autopilot – people will be self-controlled with internal social control.

[[size larger]]**[[[q:0236|Q236]]].**[[/size]] In a prisoner’s dilemma game, the rational thing for both players is to defect.  This makes mutual defection an equilibrium, though it is not a preferred one (the collective would be better off with another outcome).  In other words, in a single game of prisoner’s dilemma, cooperation is “impossible.”  But cooperation does happen in the world.  

Demonstrate your understanding of Axelrod's ideas by describing the mechanism and conditions under which this can happen without assuming anything “social” about the agents.  
[[=image soc116:images/axelrod-mechanism-01.gif]]

Explain how this works and how it adds to or modifies Smith’s and Hayek’s story about how markets can be a source of social order.

[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]

This is an opportunity to show how well you understand Axelrod's iterated PD experiments and it's relation to the question of whether cooperation can emerge "spontaneously" in the interaction between "not socialized" agents.  By not socialized we mean that we will not invoke norms or shared beliefs as the CAUSE of the cooperation.

“These results from the tournaments demonstrate that under suitable conditions, cooperation can indeed emerge in a world of egoists without central authority” (Axelrod 1984: 184.5).

“The result was another victory for TIT FOR TAT! The analysis of the data from these tournaments reveals four properties which tend to make a decision rule successful: avoidance of unnecessary conflict by cooperating as long as the other player does, provocability in the face of an uncalled for defection by the other, forgiveness after responding to a provocation, and clarity of behavior so that the other player can adapt to your pattern of action” (Axelrod 1984: 184.5).


# The text presented shows PD game and mechanism of rational egoists leading to coordination (they can reach an equilibrium)
# that can lead to cooperation (a good equilibrium) under certain conditions.  
# The second paragraph says four properties seem important: a means to avoid conflict if the other is cooperating,
# a player needs to be able to react if the other defects,
# one has to be able to "forgive" – show that players are back on good terms;
# and there needs to be clarity so the other can understand what you are doing/signaling, etc.  
# In practice, this means that selfish rational egoists can achieve order without recourse to Durkheimian internalized social values and without a centralized control mechanism
# under certain conditions.
# Primary among these is repeated play.  Axelrod adds to Smith and Hayek by providing a MECHANISM by which rational actors can just act rationally and achieve order – something that both Smith and Hayek claimed but did not really demonstrate.  
# He also puts limits on their ideas by showing one set of conditions necessary for it to work.

> “Naked emperors are easy to find but hard to explain. It is easy to explain why people comply with unpopular norms—they fear social sanctions. And it is easy to explain why people pressure others to behave the way they want them to behave. But why pressure others to do the opposite? Why would people publicly enforce a norm that they secretly wish would go away? (278)
>
> “One hypothesis is that very few would actually enforce the norm, but no one knows this. If people estimate the willingness to enforce based on the willingness to comply, and they comply based on the false belief that others will enforce, they become trapped in pluralistic ignorance—an equilibrium in which few people would actually enforce the norm but no one realizes this. However, this equilibrium can be extremely fragile. As in the Andersen story [The Emperor’s New Clothes], all that is needed is a single child to laugh at the emperor and the spell will be broken  (278).
>
> “A more robust explanation is that most people really will enforce the norm, and for the same reason that they comply—social pressure from others in the group, for whom mere compliance is not enough. To the  true believer, it is not sufficient that others go to the right art galleries, display the right body jewelry, purchase the right sports car, or support the right wing. They must do it for the right reason. Zealots believe that it is better not to comply at all than to do so simply to affirm social status (Kuran 1995a, p. 62). Such compliance lasts only so long as behavior can be monitored and social pressure is sufficient to induce acquiescence (Hechter 1987). Thus, true believers reserve special contempt for imposters. Those who comply for the wrong reason must worry about being exposed as counterfeit (278-9).

They then look for some way to confirm their sincerity. Enforcing the norm provides a low cost way to fake sincerity, to signal that one complies—not as an opportunist seeking approval—but as a true believer” (279).

# Popular enforcement of unpopular norms refers to the situation where people participate in publicly upholding a rule even though they privately do not agree with it.  
# The paradigmatic case is in Andersen's tale of the emperor's new clothes.  
# It is a puzzle because rational actors should refrain from doing this.  
# On the assumption that it occurs when people lives in groups, it is evidence, on the one hand, of the power of group organization.  
# On the other hand, it shows that groups can produce "irrational" or non-cooperative behavior.
# The authors explain this phenomenon in terms of two things.  First is a tendency to impute support for a norm if people appear willing to conform to it.  
# In other words, we do not tend to assume hypocrisy and we over-estimate how many others would enforce a norm.  
# The other, more robust explanation is that there are some "true believers" and they can create an atmosphere in which not only does one have to support a rule, one also has to show one is sincere (not just supporting it because of peer pressure).  This pressure to act sincere further concentrates the social energies making it appear as if everyone supports and would enforce a rule.

Fehr and Gintis describe experiments using a "public goods game."  In the regular game, players tended to free-ride more and more as the game progresses.  These results suggest that the sociological idea that people do the right thing because they are socialized to care about others is naive.  Most people do not act in a “pro-social” manner.  They free-ride.

When punishment is permitted, players punish free-riders even at a cost.  Public goods increase as free-riding drops.  Results like this defy the economic idea of people as selfish maximizers.  They also suggest that hierarchy (surveillance/punishment) need not be centralized.

In the light of these results and the rest of the course, how do you think individual internalization of social values/norms, hierarchy, decentralized market interaction, and groups combine to create social order?

> By the 10th round "roughly 55% of the subjects contribute nothing to the public good, and the remaining subjects contribute very little.  It seems that-at least toward the end- individual self-interest largely dominates behavior, and the view that the internalization of cooperative values in itself suffices to generate social cooperation is clearly wrong" (29).
>
> When participants are given an opportunity to punish those who do not contribute, EVEN at a cost to themselves, then free-riding drops to almost zero.  In other words, people who witness failures to contribute to the public good will "donate" the effort of enforcing the rule “one should contribute” and this changes behavior.
>
> If people are purely selfish, why would they “volunteer” to punish at their own expense?  That result challenges the economic idea that individuals are self-interested maximizers.  “Therefore, adding this punishment opportunity should not generate stable cooperation if all subjects are only self-interested and internalized values play no role in behavior” (30.4). They do this even in the last round of the game; this suggests that they are doing it "out of principle."
>
> The question is why people do this.  These folks are acting "irrationally" in that they hurt themselves in order to help the collective.  Fehr and Gintis calls these folks "strong reciprocators" - these people punish free-riders, even though it costs them to do this.  In a sense, they volunteer on behalf of society.
>
> “Strong reciprocity is the behavioral predisposition to cooperate conditionally on others’ cooperation and to punish violations of cooperative norms even at a cost to the punisher.  ..Finally, theory and evidence also indicate that the social structure of interaction plays a decisive role in shaping the emergent aggregate patterns of behavior by affecting how strongly reciprocal and self-regarding individuals interact” (27).
>
> “Decades ago, sociologists criticized the “oversocialized conception of man” (Wrong 1961) that played a prominent role in the work of Durkheim (1938) and Parsons (1937). They rightly questioned Homo Sociologicus, a creature who follows prevailing social norms without regard to self-interest. But they did not develop an alternative, empirically grounded, and widely accepted conception of the basic motivational driving forces of humans. This contrasts sharply with the approach taken by mainstream economics that rests on the notion of Homo Economicus, a creature who is rational and purely self-regarding. However, the Homo Economicus approach is also erroneous, as the assumption that humans are exclusively self-regarding has been decisively rejected by the evidence. Thus, although the lack of a model of human social behavior leaves sociology without an anchor, mainstream economics is hitched to the wrong anchor, i.e., adheres to a biased view of human nature.”

In light of Fehr/Gintis results, how do individuals, hierarchy, markets, and groups create coordination?
# Fehr and Gintis' results show a number of things.  For one, there is a role for internalized norms and values.  The "strong reciprocators" (SR) do act vicariously on behalf of society even against their own interests.
# But not everyone is a SR and so the way they have their effect is through actual punishing – a hierarchical form of interaction.  
# And, at least in our instantiation of the experiment, this happens in a group context.  
# But just a little of this and you can get spontaneous order in a simple market situation.
# Homo sociologicus – the over-socialized concept of man – needs revision since norms and social values alone do not seem to be enough to produce social order.
# Homo economicus – rational selfish actors – is also in need of revision since in the absence of group life, a chance for others to keep us in line, we would tend toward free-riding and fail to contribute to cooperative outcomes.

**1.** Let's think first.  This is mostly a simple sequence of actions.  The exception is that toward the end we hit a contingency (does the grant get funded?); if it is we continue on, if it is not we start over.  How might we describe the job?  "Write grants until you get one funded and then get on with the project.

**2.** Thus, we might describe our job at this NGO like this: "I just keep writing grants until one gets funded and then we get on with the work."  A first version of this process might look like this:
[[=image ppol225:images-flowcharts/P0243a.png]]
**3.** But we know that "keep writing grants" is actually a process that has more than one step.  In fact, opening this black box reveals four steps:

[[=image ppol225:images-flowcharts/P0243b.png]]

**4.** And so we can draw the next iteration flow chart thus:

> # Draft and review protocols vary, but one you like is to produce a draft, post it on Google docs for the team to comment on, send a prodding email to team members every few days until it looks like there are no more comments on that draft, make revisions and repeat this process until the deadline is near.

**First** we draw out the zeroth order version of the process:
[[=image ppol225:images-flowcharts/P0244a.png]]
But do we really have four steps here?  If we stop and think, we see that what is listed as step four is actually a refinement of part of step 3.  So, let's understand it as PREP > FIND TEMPLATE > DRAFTING PROCESS, where the last is itself a further black box.
**Next** we expand each of the first three black boxes.  The first is a straightforward two-step process.
[[=image ppol225:images-flowcharts/P0244b.png]]
The second is an "until logic" : keep looking for funders until you find a match:
[[=image ppol225:images-flowcharts/P0244c.png]]
The third blackbox is two steps and then another black box:
[[=image ppol225:images-flowcharts/P0244d.png]]
This last blackbox is itself multi-level.  We circulate drafts and do revisions until the deadline, but the cycle of putting a draft out there for comments is also an "until" structure: we post the draft and prod people for feedback until it seems everyone has weighed in.

These are shown as "nested" until logics.  The "inside" loop (1, in green) is posting a draft and prodding for feedback.  This then gets repeated for each new revision of the proposal until the deadline arrives - the outer loop (2, in blue).

One logic might go this way: we would expect that the more related people are, the more sacrifice they'd be willing to make to benefit one another.  And we can imagine saying "the costs outweigh the benefits given how related we are; if we were more related I might cooperate at higher cost or with lower benefit."

Each member of the collective reaps benefits from the contributions of those who decide to pitch in.  In particular, they receive some fraction [[$ \beta $]] of all the contributions.

Suppose you are in a class of 21 students and everyone is expected to prepare for class in a manner that costs 1 unit of life.  In the class itself, things go much better when people are prepared and we estimate that the benefit a student derives from the class is equal to 0.2 units of life for each person who comes prepared.

(a) What is your net payoff if you do the reading half the class rest of the class comes prepared too?
(b) What is the benefit to a shirker under the same conditions?

Interpolation means calculating the values between known data points.

Point data > create a grid > estimate (interpolate) values for each grid square assuming a "contribution" from all nearby points.  

You should know the difference between interpolation and extrapolation.

From [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapolation wikipedia]: extrapolation is the process of estimating, beyond the original observation interval, the value of a variable on the basis of its relationship with another variable. It is similar to interpolation, which produces estimates between known observations, but extrapolation is subject to greater uncertainty and a higher risk of producing meaningless results

You should be able to say something about a series of images like this:

From http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_csv.html:
Limited type recognition can be done for Integer, Real, String, Date (YYYY-MM-DD), Time (HH:MM:SS+nn) and DateTime (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+nn) columns through a descriptive file with the same name as the CSV file, but a .csvt extension. In a single line the types for each column have to be listed with double quotes and be comma separated (e.g., "Integer","String"). It is also possible to specify explicitly the width and precision of each column, e.g. "Integer(5)","Real(10.7)","String(15)". The driver will then use these types as specified for the csv columns.

From wikipedia:
Cylindrical:"normal cylindrical projection" is used to refer to any projection in which meridians are mapped to equally spaced vertical lines and circles of latitude (parallels) are mapped to horizontal lines.
[[<image cylind.png]]
Conical: "conic projection" is used to refer to any projection in which meridians are mapped to equally spaced lines radiating out from the apex and circles of latitude (parallels) are mapped to circular arcs centered on the apex.
[[<image con.png]]
Azimuthal: Azimuthal projections have the property that directions from a central point are preserved and therefore great circles through the central point are represented by straight lines on the map.
[[<image azm.png]]
Conformal: Conformal, or orthomorphic, map projections preserve angles locally, implying that they map infinitesimal circles of constant size anywhere on the Earth to infinitesimal circles of varying sizes on the map

Longitude -- the angular distance of a place east or west of the meridian at Greenwich, England, or west of the standard meridian of a celestial object, usually expressed in degrees and minutes.  //"at a longitude of 2° W"//

Latitude -- the angular distance of a place north or south of the earth's equator, or of a celestial object north or south of the celestial equator, usually expressed in degrees and minutes.  //"at a latitude of 51° N"//  [*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_latitude More Informations.]

Meridians -- a circle of constant longitude passing through a given place on the earth's surface and the terrestrial poles.

From Mapbox:
A continuous image of the world at street level detail would would be millions of pixels wide – much too large to download or hold in memory at once. In reality, web maps are made up of many small, square images called tiles. These tiles are typically 256x256 pixels and are placed side-by-side in order to create the illusion of a very large seamless image.

* Make a map showing all areas that are off-limits to registered offenders
* Calculate about how much of the city's rental market is off-limits to registered offenders based on this law.

You have
* a point layer with school locations
* a street layer
* a census blockgroup layer with information on number of rental units (or at least renter occupied units as of the last census)

For the first task, create a 1000 m buffer on the schools point layer.  You may want to clip it to the census block group layer (using it as a city boundary layer).  It may be graphically more attractive if the buffers are merged into one and made semitransparent.

For task two, a very crude estimate might be arrived at by looking at blockgroups that do not intersect the buffer at all and comparing number of renter units in them to the total in the city.  To get a slightly better estimate we might take a union of the buffer and the block groups and then, making the assumption that rentals are uniformly distributed within each block group, use the relative areas of the parts that overlap the buffer and the parts that don't to estimate the number of rentals ruled out by the law.

From Wikipedia:

The Broad Street cholera outbreak was a severe outbreak of cholera that occurred near Broad Street (now renamed Broadwick Street) in Soho district of London, England in 1854. This outbreak is best known for the physician John Snow's study of the outbreak and his discovery that cholera is spread by contaminated water. This discovery came to influence public health and the construction of improved sanitation facilities beginning in the 19th century.

This diagram shows the two standard parallels for a conical projection.  Conical projections are generated by wrapping the projection surface into a cone that fits over the globe from a pole such that the conical surface is tangent to the sphere along a line of latitude, or, more commonly, passes shallowly through the sphere so that it is tangent at two small circles or latitudes that we call "standard parallels."  The resulting graticule is fan-shaped.  All features lying on the concentric circles of the standard parallels would be undistorted with minimal distortion between them (provided they are close together) and more distortion as we move north or south.  This projection is often used for local coordinate systems in territories that stretch more east-west than north south.

It has come down to two candidates, one rather plain vanilla and, frankly, a bit boring, but rock solid, and the other quite exciting and edgy.  After all the interviews and due diligence, you and your board estimate that that with the boring candidate there is a 94% likelihood that she'll be OK, a 5% chance that she'll be amazing, and a 1% chance that she'll be a disaster.  You estimate the "value" of OK to be 25, the value of amazing to be 100 and the value of disaster to be -100.

(A) What is the expected value of hiring the boring candidate?

The board estimates that there is a 60% chance that the edgy candidate is amazing and a 40% chance she will be a disaster.  

(B) What is the expected value of hiring the edgy candidate?  Other things being equal, what is the best decision here?

A consultant friend of your tells you about a personality test that you can administer to job candidates that helps distinguish between those likely to be amazing and those likely to be a disaster.  

(C) With the above assumptions, how much would it be worth to have this test to use on your edgy candidate (the test would tell you for sure whether this particular edgy person is the amazing or the disaster type)?

But suppose it's not a perfect test, but it's pretty good.  It turns out that with candidates who really are amazing it gets it right about 75% of the time.  With those who are actually disasters waiting to happen, it gets that right 90% of the time.

(D) If the test were administered to our edgy candidate and she passed, how likely is it that she'd be amazing?  And if she failed, how likely she was actually a disaster?

(E) How much would we be willing to pay for the imperfect test?

The latter are not actively looking for work having given up on the idea that its possible to find.  These groups are **not** included in the denominator when the unemployment rate is calculated.  The simple version of the unemployment rate is, then,  

[[math]]
UR = \frac {Unemployed} {Employed + Unemployed}
[[/math]]

Some recent op-eds have counseled caution about optimism that the overall unemployment rate has been going down because it might reflect growth in the number of people no longer looking for work.  We'll think about that with a Markov model.  We'll simplify the states a worker can be in:
* employed (E)
* short term unemployed - 14 weeks or less (US)
* long term unemployed - over 14 weeks (LS)
* Marginally attached to the labor force - no longer looking for a job (MALF)

Let's construct a simplified Markov model of unemployment based on transition rates shown here:

[[=image ppol225:images-markov/markov_transition_table.png]]

If the unemployment rate is calculated as the ratio of those who are short term unemployed (US) plus those who are long term unemployed (UL) to the total labor force (E + US + UL), how would things evolve over the next twelve months if the starting numbers are these:
[[=image ppol225:images-markov/markov_starting_point.png]]

What will the unemployment rate be?  Even if it is agreed that getting unemployment to near 6% is a policy goal, are there reasons the results might not be a cause for celebration?

Create a chart showing changes over the next 12 months.  Suggestion: plot total employment (E) on secondary axis since it's such a large number. In the alternative, put it on a separate chart.

In the following paragraph he writes "The individual life of the human spirit contains incongruent elements, such as tenets of faith and superstition which, stemming from various individual complexes, muddy the purity of any theory or system.  Both Kepler and Newton, who contributed so much to the modern concept of nature, were ritualistic and religious in thei basic attitudes. Rousseau's idea of education had much greater relevance to the thought collective than to his own individual life." (57.9-58.1)

The point would seem to be that a person can switch, as it were, between various "thinking orbits" but when ideas are put into circulation they lose nuance and gain solidity as they are repeated back and forth among people. They might fade in importance for their originator even as they become established in the group.

[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
sociological wholism refers to the idea that there is actually a "thing" called society, a reality that is over and above the constituent individuals.  We contrast this view with methodological reductionism or methodological individualism which is the idea that all there "is" are individuals acting and that any supra-individual concepts refer only to mental constructs.

Relatedly, sociological realism is the idea that "society" and "the social" actually exist as contrasted with nominalism which holds that these things exist "in name only."

[[iftags _showsolutions]]
[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
Mead sees the self as having two sides, the subject side (myself as active, doing, perceiving, experiencing, capable of choosing and acting) and the object side (myself as fact, as seen by others, as fixed in a role).  

When I "see myself as others do" I am internalizing their view of me as object (I am an object in their world). I can start to understand how my actions (which I experience immediately as a subject) go out into the world and become objects for others to react to. By internalizing these things I can orient my actions socially - to get the reactions or make the impression that I want to.

For Mead, it is only by internalizing lots of others' views of me as object that I can generate enough of an internalized generalized other to be able to be competent in society. My "social self" comes into being when I've done this.

This is an opportunity to show that you are paying attention to the metanarrative that Hechter and Horne use to organize the selections in the text as well as an opportunity to show off what you know about Weber.

Or Engels has this oppressive state serving the interest of the ruling class - but how do they pull it off on a day to day basis?

Weber: if state is seen as legitimate, the rules will be obeyed in the absence of coercion. He finds three different authority structures that are seen as legitimate sources of authority:

* patrimonial - based on personal loyalty

* bureaucratic - exploits a division of labor, relies on expertise rather than personal dependence
 
* charismatic - based on devotion exceptional sanctity of charismatic authority

“Every genuine form of legitimate domination implies a minimum of voluntary compliance, that is, an interest (based on ulterior motives or genuine acceptance) in obedience.” -- Weber (103.3)

Use this as an opportunity to show what you know about Marx and Engels (you might mention the dominant ideology thesis and what Marx called religion), but mostly Engels. What did he write in the excerpt on the origins of the state that suggest this sort of duping. Remember his comments about universal suffrage and corporate power and democratic institutions.

The classes in power are able to manipulate and subdue those who are uneducated or too poor to change their circumstances. They do this by using education, media and religion (among other institutions) to maintain their control.

Examples:
Broadcast media has depicted victims of police brutality as deserving of their treatment by dehumanizing and criminalizing their character.
In education, children of immigrant families are usually sent to schools that are underfunded and segregated. This keeps them from advancing in society, therefore staying in a disadvantaged state. Those who hold power want to keep them in these lower classes so they maintain their power.

Most societies have a higher class exploiting an oppressed class, this is how states usually exist. So, states arose out of a necessity to maintain and control the clashes between these classes.

Treat this as an opportunity to show you know who Weber is and a bit of what he had to say about authority, legitimate domination, and bureaucracy.

To zero in on the last part of the question, you have to get a sense of what we mean by formalistic - it's about following rules, treating things by the rules. The opposite would be informality. And what he means by "impersonality" - remember that while it is nice if the bank manager or teller knows your name, you really don't want them to be treating customers or customers' money in some sort of "personal" manner (better treatment for my friends, etc.).  You want the bureaucracy to treat you "like a number."  Be sure you can explain this to the proverbial taxi driver.

[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]

"Leveling" here means making people more equal - but not in some socialist sense. Rather, socio-economic differences are reduced when bureaucracy pushes decisions, distinctions, etc. to be based on rational criteria rather than ascribed statuses. The flip side, to a critic, might be that this then legitimizes those differences that remain (since they must be based on rational criteria).

Much of our rhetoric of "fairness" relates to the general idea of "due process" - we require of decisions that they are made according to rules and criteria that apply the same to everyone.  It's not one rule for that group and another rule for this group.  In this sense, the rule or rules levels out social differences that might otherwise hold sway.

[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
From whom or what do the lads seem to need to distinguish themselves?
* Putting distance between them and drabness/conformity (126.8)
* DJR: I would add parents, school, establishment to emphasize that there are very concrete GROUPS and CATEGORIES between which they wan to establish distance and distinction. In identity matters, not being "them" is as important as being us.


What are some of the ways the lads express their opposition?
* Personal style consists of alternative dress. Use of cigarettes at school, drinking in pubs, skipping class.

Think about their use of a symbolic regime to accomplish this.
* Appropriation of working class consumer goods (clothing, cigarettes, and alcohol).
* Creation of informal groups; creation of distinctive culture within grouping.
* All kinds of looks and gestures and body language. Part of what is important about the symbolic aspects of these forms of resistance is their opacity to the adults; there is a bonus/thrill having a system of symbols that authority does not understand.

What does Willis mean to communicate with the phrase "flaunting their impertinence"? (127.7)
* The lads’ do not just smoke, they take delight in being seen smoking by faculty. Breaking the rule gratuitously, and not just surreptitiously, is what is valued.

How is the "adult male working class world" a source of resistance material for the lads? (127.8)
* Like smoking, drinking is associated with adult male working class world and becomes a “source of material for resistance and exclusion”. What is signaled is that “the individual is separate and their presence is an alternative, superior, and more mature mode of social being.” This is so effectively signaled that  The lads’ get a thrill out of being spotted out drinking in pub and they know it more deviant than being spotted smoking

What are some ways that the lads express that they are in another world and it is inaccessible to staff and 'ear'oles'?
* Joey says they can be punished by teachers who re a part of a bigger establishment than students. (122)
* Eddie says teachers think they are high and mighty. Joey says students are under them. (122-123)
* Joey says they can be physically punished or forced to do more work (123)
* Spanksy says the lads’ will look back on life with a specialized experience inaccessible to the ear’oles e.g.fighting, having a laff (125)
* Joey mentions they have developed their own vernacular  (128.6)

See p. 131.

In the shop there is an "attempt to gain informal control of the work process..." found which include how machines are manned and speed of production.

In counter-school culture the lads' mimic these attempts to take control of the classroom, disturb the official timetable, and take control of routine/life spaces in at least these three ways:

1) rests on organizational (131.3) - "informal group locates and makes possible all other elements"
2) attitude toward conformists (131.4) - "informal group on the shop floor also shows the same attitude to conformists and informers as do 'the lads'.... and ostracism is the punishment for not maintaining the integrity of the world"
3) value practical knowledge over theory (132.1) - "practical ability always comes first and is a condition of other kinds of knowledge"

These expressions are pretty much "out of the book."  You should work with them to develop your own understanding of what Willis is saying.

If you read carefully you will see that the types of "authority" he is talking about refer to the leader's capacity to control and direct the staff as much as to the leader's capacity to dominate "the led."  Discuss Weber's types of legitimate domination as forms of maintaining organizational integrity.

[[iftags _showsolutions]]

[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
NOTE: see also [[[q:0378|Q. 378]]] and [[[q:0380|Q. 380]]].
First and foremost this question is asking you to "get" the idea that social order usually requires AN organization and that sustaining AN organization over time is a serious sociological challenge.  

It also asks you to have a gut level appreciation for what we mean by staff as in people to carry out the business of an organization.  In other contexts you might here, in this connection, a distinction between LINE and STAFF.  Line people are the bosses and sub-bosses and sub-sub-bosses up and down the "chain of command."  Staff are the people who work at each level and actually carry out the work.

You will probably want to describe how Weber says that rational calculation by subordinates (want to do what the boss wants so boss will treat me well) or feelings (I like working for this boss) or values (I agree with organization's goals) are not sufficiently reliable for ongoing organization. The trick to showing what you know here is how to get from this to the idea that to make this thing work, we need to have subordinates believe IN THE ORGANIZATION (or maybe even the "organization-ness of the organization).

This is an opportunity to show that you are paying attention to the metanarrative that Hechter and Horne use to organize the selections in the text as well as an opportunity to show off what you know about Weber.

Hector & Horne cites Nozick 1974, “To be governed is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-drive, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated at controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have either neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so…” It is a very expensive proposition for the state watch all of us all of the time. Hobbes can have his Leviathan, but does he, perhaps underestimate how much effort goes into being a Leviathan if that's all there is?  Or Engels has this oppressive state serving the interest of the ruling class - but how do they pull it off on a day to day basis?  The system is much more efficient if people actually want to do what the state mandates.

Weber: if state is seen as legitimate, the rules will be obeyed in the absence of coercion. He finds three different authority structures that are seen as legitimate sources of authority:

* patrimonial - based on personal loyalty

* bureaucratic - exploits a division of labor, relies on expertise rather than personal dependence
 
* charismatic - based on devotion exceptional sanctity of charismatic authority

“Every genuine form of legitimate domination implies a minimum of voluntary compliance, that is, an interest (based on ulterior motives or genuine acceptance) in obedience.” -- Weber (103.3)

The name prisoner's dilemma comes from a scenario that fits a generic arrangement of two actors' intertwined fates: two people are arrested and charged with a crime; the police separate them and offer each a deal — betray your partner in crime and receive a lighter sentence, or risk being betrayed by your partner and receiving a harsher sentence. The best outcome occurs if you both keep your mouth shut, the worst overall if you both talk, but the worst for you as an individual is if you get ratted out and the best for you as an individual is if you rat out your partner.
If you keep your mouth shut we say you are cooperating with your partner; if you talk you are defecting from the partnership. (177.7)

We want to discover the conditions in which cooperation can emerge — we assume that individuals are never acting in a pure social vacuum and that things in the environment (including arrangements of the agents, numbers, distributions of information, etc.) can have an effect on whether they cooperate.

> Fate is regarded as a substitute for the parental agency. If a man is unfortunate it means that he is no longer loved by this highest power; and, threatened by such a loss of love, he once more bows to the parental representative in his super-ego -- a representative whom, in his days of good fortune, he was ready to neglect. This becomes especially clear where looked Fate is looked upon in the strictly religious sense of being nothing else than an expression of the Divine Will. The people of Israel had believed themselves to be the favorite child of God, and when the great. Father caused misfortune after misfortune to rain down upon this people of his, they were never shaken in their belief in his relationship to them or questioned his power or righteousness. Instead, they produced the prophets, who held up their sinfulness before them; and out of their sense of guilt they created the over-strict commandments of their priestly religion. It is remarkable how differently a primitive man behaves. If he has met with a misfortune, he does not throw the blame on himself but on his fetish, which has obviously not done its duty, and he gives it a thrashing instead of punishing himself.

Some ideas:

One might start by briefly describing both pieces with a focus on where norms fit in each.

Think about how both articles say, in part, "if people were JUST rational, you'd expect one thing, but in practice you see another."

Do you think Fehr and Gintis' "strong reciprocators" are just a personality type - they like to punish, want others to behave fairly? Or are they different because they have an inclination to enforce social norms?

If norms are rules that reflect behavioral preferences of groups, what do we even mean by an "unpopular" norm?  

Compare the dynamics of behavior, observation of others' behavior, reaction to others' behavior, signals sent by reactions in the public goods simulation and in the kinds of situations Centola et al. are describing.

Can you imagine a game or experiment for investigating pluralistic ignorance?

We are proposing an inexpensive family trip from Charleston, South Carolina, to Des Moines, Iowa, to visit relatives during December school holidays. The seasonal trip we dream of taking from Charleston to Des Moines is the “program.” Basic assumptions about our trip “program” are:
* We want to visit relatives between 12/10/00 and 1/5/01 while the children are out of school.
* We will fly from South Carolina to Iowa because it takes less time than driving and because frequent flier (FF) miles are available.
* Using frequent flier miles will reduce travel costs.
*
We have to determine the factors influencing our trip, including necessary resources, such as, the number of family members, scheduled vacation time, the number of frequent flier miles we have, round trip air reservations for each family member, and transportation to and from our home to the airport. The activities necessary to make this happen are the creation of our own family holiday schedule, securing our Iowa relative’s schedule, garnering air line information and reservations and planning for transportation to and from the airport.

(a) As a part of its considerations about the park project, Ourville needs to think about the opportunity costs associated with each tract of land being considered for the park. What is an opportunity cost? You are nominated to explain (BRIEFLY) in terms the public will understand what we mean by opportunity cost:

(b) While discussing the value of the park options to residents the term "willingness to pay" comes up. Explain (BRIEFLY) to the public what this means.

(a) Opportunity cost is the value we forgo by taking a particular course of action. What is the next best thing I could have done with the resources I use on this project. In this case, we are building parks and so we presume that the community has to have a conversation about what other uses there are for the land in question.

(b) In cost benefit analysis, on way to "put a price" on something is to ask what people would be willing to pay for it. We don't just ask something like "what is convenient parking worth to you?"; instead we ask, "Would you be willing to pay $25 for a parking permit? How about $50?" etc.

One part of the staff report talks about discounting. A resident asks "where do discount rates come from?" Your (BRIEF) answer:

[[iftags _showsolutions]]
[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
Short answer: we look them up.  In a given policy environment there will often be a conventional discount rate based on an agreed upon logic.  Discount rates depend on opportunity costs -- when we are talking about public expenditure we have to ask "what would be the return on these resources in private investment?" Thus, one convenient default is the long term average return of the stock market -- something like 7 or 8%.  

Main points are two: 1) it is meant to reflect the economic conditions in which a decision is embedded; 2) it reflects a consensus within an analytical community.

[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
The Pareto criterion says a project is worth doing if it improves the welfare of at least some stakeholders without diminishing the welfare of any.  The [[[ppol225-glossary:kaldor-hicks-criteria| Kaldor-Hicks]]] criterion says a project is worth doing if it has a positive net benefit because even if that benefit is unevenly distributed, relative "winners" can, in theory, compensate others and still have something left over.[[/span]]

One option on the table for the community of Ourville is to build a park on the west side of town.  Should we spend $100 to build a new park?  Studies have determined that the park will provide $132 of benefits to the community's residents.  What do you recommend and why?

This is a type 2A problem: choose one of several alternatives.  The fundamental rule is "select the project with the highest net benefit."
 
The net benefits are shown on the last line of the table.  Project B has the higher NB and so it should be selected.  The group 2 families can make a payment of 40 to the group 1 families and they will have the same benefit they would have had under project A and the group 2 families will still have 70 leftover.

This is a "choose the appropriate scale of a single project" (type 2b) problem.  The fundamental rule is "expand the project until marginal cost equals marginal benefit."
 
Here marginal benefit (MB) exceeds marginal cost until level 4.  Expanding from 2 to 3 (spending the next 25 after already having invested 50) yields MB=30.  But expanding from 3 to 4 (raising cost from 75 to 100) yields an additional benefit of only 12.  Since this MB is less than the MC (25) we don't make this investment.  The project should stop at level 3.

This is multiple projects, scaleable, with budget constraint (type 4).  The fundamental rule is "expand projects until the marginal net benefits are equal across all projects."  In practice this means starting from the marginal net benefit curves above and investing incrementally, each time selecting the next available investment with the largest MNB.
[[=image 225:images-cba/q0475-cba-02.jpg]]
 
Here we assume that the given information implies that these projects can be scaled up in units costing 25.  Our first 25 takes project A to level 1.  Then project B goes to 1 because of the available "next steps" taking B from 0 to 1 has higher MNB (0.68) than taking A from 1 to 2 (0.6).  Now we are "at" 25 on both projects.  The best opportunity (highest MNB) we are looking at is 0.92 associated with moving project B from level 1 to level 2.  After this, it's the 0.6 of going from A1 to A2.  Then, the 5th and 6th investments go to both projects at level 3 (at a MNB of 0.2).  After this, we exhaust our budget with two more investments in project B.  

The end result is expanding project A to level 3 and project B to level 5, both with a MNB of 0.2.

The Ourville Alliance, a neighborhood group whose members include several MPPs, likes decision trees. And they think the benefits of the different park options are not certain. In fact, they think that Option A has a 75% chance of a net benefit of 60 and a 25% chance of being a bust and having a net benefit of only 20. By comparison, Option B has a 90% chance of having a net benefit of 50 and a 10% chance of a net benefit of only 10. Sketch in details, labels, etc. on this decision tree as necessary. What do you recommend and why?

Earlier in the process, two options were on the table for the community of Ourville.  One proposal was for a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_park pocket park] that will cost only $10 and is projected to have $50 benefit -- a benefit to cost ratio of 5 to 1.  The other proposal is a more elaborate park that will cost $50 and have a benefit of $100 -- a benefit to cost ratio of 2 to 1.  The town budget could afford either project – either one pocket park or one larger park,  but not both.  What would you recommend and why?

[[iftags _showsolutions]]
[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]
Benefit/Cost ratios can mislead.  In this case, it is true that the pocket-park option delivers more "bang for buck" -- the rate is 5 to 1! -- than the other project (which is only 2 to 1).  But our job is to maximize NB.  Here the project that does that is the more elaborate park.  We are told that we can afford either (but not both) and so we should deliver the maximum net benefit.

Note that in a fuller analysis we might inquire as to what other options were available for the remaining 40 if we were to choose the pocket park.  It could be that when other projects were added to the mix -- projects, for example that could return a benefit of 60 for the investment of that 40, then the NB of the package (it would now be 50+60) would exceed the 100 promised by the more elaborate park.  But that would be a different problem.

The amounts are expressed in simple numbers – e.g., $100 – which you can assume to be referring to realistic amounts – e.g., hundreds of thousands.

In comparing options for the park projects in Ourville, staff have noted that equipment choices will have an impact on maintenance costs down the line.  Two swing sets, in particular, are being considered.  One is very expensive up front, but has a very favorable maintenance outlook.  The other is less expensive, but might need repairs and even to be replaced during the expected lifetime of the sturdier set.  Data is below (based on a 7% discount rate).  We assume annual community benefits from using the park to be 2000 (except in the year where the cheaper swing set would have to be replaced).  The town budget could afford either project, but not both.  What do you recommend and why?  Explain to a public audience what is going on here.
[[=image 225:images-cba/q0478-cba-01.jpg]]

[[iftags _showsolutions]]
[[collapsible show="+ Show solution" hide="- Hide solution"]]
[[span style="color:green; font-family:courier;"]]

Both our options involve up-front costs and future costs and benefits. To properly compare the options we need to calculate the "present value" of these future streams of costs and benefits. These tables list the cost and benefit and then the net benefit — benefits minus costs — for each year over the next ten years.

Each of these future net benefits is then "discounted" using a standard social discount rate that takes into account the fact that a payment 10 years from now is worth less than a payment today.
Then, in the upper left of each table we see the net present value — the sum of the present values of each year's net benefits. What we see is that even though the sturdier swing set is initially more than twice as expensive, it's maintenance costs are significantly lower making it the better investment in the long run. The present value of this option is almost 20% higher than that of the "more economical" option.

[[size larger]]**[[[q:0479|Q479]]].**[[/size]] Some old cars are being driven by people who take the attitude "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" and "sure, it might not be efficient or clean, but I can't afford to buy a new car." These cars use too much fuel and they pollute the air causing health problems in the population.   Assume new cars are zero emission and so create zero health care costs. Each old car, on average, contributes to pollution and health care costs to the tune of $300 per year. We want to run a program to get 100 "junkers" off the road each year for the next three years by offering a $2000 rebate to people who swap a junker for a brand new zero emission vehicle.  Working with a ten year time horizon and an initial discount rate of 3.5%, compute the NPV of the project.  Then adjust the the subsidy to determine how large a subsidy we can give and still have the project worth doing. Then compute the IRR of the project at both the original amount and this new amount.
