question: "For each of the following, indicate whether the structure is basically FIFO or LIFO.\n\nPeople waiting for a bus\nDishes piled in your cabinet\nStuff you put in a rubbish bin\nCanned goods on a store shelf\nThings we recall according to the recency bias\nYour garments during Canadian winter\nThe ingredients in an ice cream sundae\nArtifacts in different strata during an archeological excavation\nPosts in a blog\n"
solution: ": People waiting for a bus - FIFO : If we assume people politely queue up for the bus; the first person into the queue would be the first person able to board the bus.\n: Dishes piled in your cabinet - LIFO : If we assume that we pile clean dishes on top of unused dishes still in the cabinet then the last dish stacked will be the first dish used.\n: Stuff you put in a rubbish bin - LIFO : The first thing into the rubbish bin is on the bottom, the last thing is on top. So, if we take things out of the bin, we first take the last item discarded\n: Canned goods on a store shelf - LIFO : It's LIFO if we assume new items are added to the empty space at the front of the shelf. Of course, a good shopkeeper will \"rotate her stock\" putting the newer items at the back. Always check the sell-by dates.\n: Things we recall according to the recency bias - LIFO : The recency bias says we find it easier to recall information recently obtained. Thus, the order of our recall will be last info in, first info recalled.\n: Your garments during Canadian winter - LIFO : If we dress in layers, the first thing we take off is the last thing we put on.\n: The ingredients in an ice cream sundae - LIFO : The dessert is built from the bottom up, with the cherry on top. In general, we have to start eating from the top down. It might be more fun, though, to go right to the good stuff and try to eat it FIFO-style, even if that makes a mess\n: Artifacts in different strata during an archeological excavation - LIFO : The fundamental logic of excavation is that the more recently deposited material are on top.\n: Posts in a blog - LIFO : Most blogs are organized with the most recent post on top\n: Groceries unpacked in your kitchen - FIFO : As we go around the store shopping we place items one by one into our cart. At the checkout we remove them LIFO and put them on the checkout band. Then they are packed into our carry bags with the last selected item on the bottom. Thus, when we get home, we unpack the items FIFO - the first things we put into our cart are the first things out of the carry bag."

Students must be taught to be conscious of the involved decisions and to critically examine and to reject solutions, sometimes even if they are correct as far as the result is concerned; they must learn to weigh the various aspects of design alternatives in the light of these criteria. In particular, they must be taught to revoke earlier decisions, and to back up, if necessary even to the top.

{"title": "The Whole Course as expressed in Wirth 1971",
"content": problem-type: '1'
question: "Reread the opening paragraph of Wirth's article.\_\n\n\n> Programming is usually taught by examples. Experience shows that the success of a programming course critically depends on the choice of these examples. Unfortunately, they are too often selected with the prime intent to demonstrate what a computer can do. Instead, a main criterion for selection should be their suitability to exhibit certain widely applicable techniques. Furthermore, examples of programs are commonly presented as finished \"products\" followed by explanations of their purpose and their linguistic details. But active programming consists of the design of new programs, rather than contemplation of old programs. As a consequence of these teaching methods, the student obtains the impression that programming consists mainly of mastering a language (with all the peculiarities and intricacies so abundant in modern PL's) and relying on one's intuition to somehow transform ideas into finished programs. Clearly, programming courses should teach methods of design and construction, and the selected examples should be such that a gradual development can be nicely demonstrated. \n\nRewrite it as a note to a friend explaining what we are trying to learn in this course."
solution: "Here's my attempt:\n\nCoding courses teach with examples and success depends on good examples. The usual approach is to choose examples that show what the computer can do rather than exhibiting how we approach solving problems. In particular, examples should help us to appreciate the \"thought moves\" we make when crafting solutions. The common practice of showing finished code runs counter to how we actually experience solving a problem. What we need is instruction about where to start and how to proceed, not explanations and descriptions of the destination. Conventional methods make it seem like programming is about learning syntax and deploying unarticulateable intuitions. What we want to do instead is illustrate the step by step, gradual construction of solutions."

flowchart-p0034-wiredflowcharts-a.png
"
solution: "++++++ Single entry, single exit for each logical unit not observed\nBiggest flaw in these things. The designers appear oblivious to the concept. And they probably are. The authors of these charts exhibit almost zero appreciation for the logical unit. There is no abstraction between levels of logic in most of these. Lots of early computer code (with the infamous GOTO command) looked like these. It was, in general, not a good thing.\nThe \"structured programming\" movement was a backlash against such messy logic.\n

flowchart-p0034-wiredflowcharts-c.png
\n++++++ No vertical alignment to help the eye see the logical flow.\nYes. This one is typical. We have a concession to visual logic with the start in the upper left hand corner but the eye can discern nothing of the overall logic of this process. All we can do is follow through the diagram like making our way through a maze. They can be forgiven since visual real estate in a magazine layout is precious, but it's a flaw we'd point out. Visually, these things are fun, but not easy to read. More importantly for our purposes, when flowcharts are laid out like this, mistake too easily hide. The whole point is to expose our logic in a visually explicit manner.\n

flowchart-p0034-wiredflowcharts-b.png
\n++++++ Most of the decisions are not binary (two valued, yes/no)\nAlthough they are not always worded as true/false or yes/no, and the exits from decision diamonds (and sometimes not diamonds) are often at odd angles, this is not a really common flaw in these charts.\n++++++ Too many colors\nWhile this may be true and might offend your design eye, the question of color is not really a part of how we are specifying a well-formed flow chart. Some of them are a bit overly colorful but that's more style than substance. We wouldn't use them in many professional contexts, but no offense against logic.\n++++++ Too many branches\nThis is not in and of itself a problem or violation of good flowchart practice. The humour in most of these flowcharts requires fine grained distinctions - a fine thing, but to represent them in rigorous flowchart language we would need a lot both horizontal and vertical space.\nThe \"structured programmingLinks to an external site.\" movement was a backlash against such messy logic."

Represent this information as a three level stepwise refinement. _\n> # Preparing to write a grant consists of identifying a need and putting together a logic model that shows what new inputs are needed to generate desired outcomes\n> # Finding a funder requires identifying a list of funders, looking up the kinds of projects they are funding, and finding matches for your project\n> # Writing a grant involves (1) preparing to write the grant; (2) finding template appropriate to particular funders; (3) producing drafts and reviewing with staff\n> # Draft and review protocols vary, but one you like is to produce a draft, post it on Google docs for the team to comment on, send a prodding email to team members every few days until it looks like there are no more comments on that draft, make revisions and repeat this process until the deadline is near.\n"
solution: "First we draw out the zeroth order version of the process:\n

flowchart-p0025-grant-writing-a.png
\nBut do we really have four steps here? If we stop and think, we see that what is listed as step four is actually a refinement of part of step 3. So, let's understand it as PREP > FIND TEMPLATE > DRAFTING PROCESS, where the last is itself a further black box.\nNext we expand each of the first three black boxes. The first is a straightforward two-step process.\n

Data on hand says that current levels are 4 kg per household of four per week. The plan is to spend $10,000 on advertising each month until the level has gone over 6 kg per week for four weeks in a row.\nPrefatory concern – what does 4 kg / household of 4 / week mean? The amount of compost likely depends on the number of people in a household. We don't want to get the numbers wrong by failing to take this into account. So, in our data collection, we double the number for households of 2, halve it for households of 8, etc. Why not just express it as \"kg/person/week\"? That would work fine mathematically.

solution: "This \"system\" sorts clients into three categories – either you are between steps 3 and 4 (working on drug tests), you are ready to do step 4, or you are out of the program. We need a black box that will sort clients into one of two categories: on to step four or out of program.\n\n

flowchart-p0016-juvenile-protocol-a.gif
\nThe main test for being out of the program is failing three tests. Otherwise you are still in until you pass three in a row. So, in English it might be \"while you haven't failed thrice, keep testing until you get three in a row clean.\"\n\n

\nWhat does \"All the Rest\" have to accomplish? Drug tests. Count successes and failures. Warn on one failure, counseling on two. Reset success to zero after a failure. To think clearly about this, I want to remember that all I need to do is design logic that has a single entry point and a single exit point and that at the exit point we'll be ready to apply these tests about whether we are in the 3 passes in a row state, the 3 failures state, or the try again state.\n\nLet's write out the logic in English:\n\nTake a drug test.\nIf you pass, add one to the number of passed tests.\nIf you fail, set number of passed tests to zero (start over) and add one to the number of failed tests.\nIf you have one failed test, get a warning\nIf you have two failed tests, get counseling\nI have an urge to follow this up with the next two tests, but remember I've got my \"repeat while until\" logic outside this black box.

This will be FAXed daily to (608)743-1759 to provide that office with a list of the defendants they should expect the following Tuesday for the initial screening. \n# Upon completion of the initial screening the Community RECAP office will FAX to the Criminal Court a document indicating the completion of the initial screening and whether the defendant is qualified for the Drug Court. If the defendant is eligible, the Community RECAP office will provide the defendant with an appointment date (scheduled after his next scheduled return to the Criminal court) for completion of the intake process and to complete a full assessment of the defendants needs. The defendant will also be scheduled with an initial date for first appearance at Drug Court. This information will also be contained in the FAX sent to the Criminal court. \n# After the initial screening, the defendant returns to the Criminal Court. If the Community RECAP FAX (from #5 above) has been received by the court and it indicates that the defendant is eligible for the Drug Court, then the Criminal Court will take the plea to the original charge but will withhold a finding of guilt. The Court will then order the clerk to place the file in status “Deferred Pending”, continue bond and order the defendant to the Drug Court appearance indicated on that FAX. \n# The Court Attendant will then photocopy the following documents, place them in an envelope, and forward them to Judge John Roethe of the Drug Court as these documents will constitute the Drug Court file:\n # Criminal complaint, \n # Completed Drug Court Contract, \n # NCIC or CCAP criminal history of the defendant, \n # Community RECAP Program FAX indicating the completion of the initial screening and initial date for first appearance before the Drug Court. \n# The matter will not return to the Criminal Court until the defendant either successfully completes the program or is removed from the program. If the defendant successfully completed the program the court will implement the agreement outlined in the Drug Court Contract. If for any reason the defendant fails to complete the program the defendant’s original plea will be perfected the entry of a finding of guilt and the matter will proceed to sentencing on the original charge.\n"

question: "Use stepwise refinement to evolve a flowchart for this set of instructions: \nDo A and then B. \nIf C, then while E do F and after that do G, otherwise do H. \nDo I."
solution: "\"Do A and then B. If C, then while E do F and after that do G, otherwise do H. Do I.\"\n\nStart by looking at the syntax of the logic to make sure we understand it.\n\nStep 1: do A\nStep 2: do B\nStep 3: If C, then while E do F and after that do G, otherwise do H\nStep 4: do I\n\nDo a first draft that treats step three as a black box.\n

\nNext, starting from the outside and working in, we draw the flow chart for \"if C do something (the while stuff) otherwise do something else (H)\":\n\n

\nAnd now, let's leave the \"while loop\" as a black box and fill in a few more details. It's now \"if C do the while thing and then do G.\n\n

solution: "This medical advice protocol has two top level parts: one for women and one for men.\n\nFor women, it says those over 40 should have the test. And it says no matter what your age, if either parent had diabetes you should have the test.\nFor men, it says only take the test if you are overweight.\n\nWe might be tempted to distraction by phrases like \"no matter what\" and \"only\" but a little bit of parsing and rephrasing helps to clarify.\n\nflowchart-p0005.gif\n"

We insert a circle (D) above it to collect the entry branch from A and the entry branch from C and add a module exit point, E, and a module entrance point, F.\n\nIn the second diagram we infer a decision at D because there are two exit branches.

source: RileyHunt2014a
feedback: 'Although it might seem pedantic, sticking with the conventions we have described in this course (circles, rectangles, and diamonds; single entry and single exit from modules; standard true/false meaning for branches out of decision diamonds) promotes visual/logical resonance and encourages slow and deliberate algorithmic analysis and description.'
