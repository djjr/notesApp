In this module participants will learn the importance of along with the basics of how to do \"back of the envelope calculations.\"<br>We know from studies of real world behavior that we are subject to bounded rationality = we rarely have all the information we\'d like, the time or techniques to fully analyze the information we have, the luxury of complete rationality. But we this does not give us an excuse to put our heads in the sand or just to \"wing it.\" Back of the envelope (BOTE) or Fermi calculations are a solution to this problem.
