    <h3>What is the popUp Curriculum?</h3>
    <p class="webpara">There are a lot of nuggets of learning buried in any given course
        and many of them would be interesting and useful or even really
        important to people who will never take that course. And there
        are questions we have right now, today, this hour, for which "go
        take a course on X" is NOT an answer. I know a music professor who
        does an incredible piece on improvisation that would be pure gold
        for my public policy students. When my rapid prototyping students
        ask why some 3d printer filament melts at a higher temperature, I
        could say, "Well, that's polymer chemistry. You can take chem 1
        and then chem 2 and then organic 1 and 2 and at the end of organic 2
        you get to polymersâ€¦." But that's just not going to happen.
        Alternatively, I can call up my colleague in the chemistry department
        and arrange for a one hour basic introduction to plastics and polymers
        for tomorrow afternoon.

        The popUp curriculum consists of short, independent learning sessions that
        are scheduled opportunistically. Most commonly they'll be 2 to 3 hour workshops,
        but sometimes they'll be a series of meetings over a few days or weeks. They can
        happen because a workshop leader happens to be in town or because an instructor
        has identified a "right now" skill need. Or they may occur when a few instructors
        realize their courses have an overlap that can be "popped out" and shared. Or
        faculty have identified ancillary skills that make sense at a particular point
        in a cohort's developmental trajectory. Or pedagogical auxiliaries such as career
        services can offer a training that gets extra bang when it can be "co-branded"
        with the popUp series. Or a field trip opportunity that doesn't fall under just
        one course presents itself. Or we want to take advantage of non-traditional
        teaching resources - such as the facilities person who is a master wood worker -
        that would not fit into the conventions of course-based learning.
